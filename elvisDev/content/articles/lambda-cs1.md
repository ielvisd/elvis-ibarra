      <h2><span class="cs14">CS15</span> Week 1 - <span class="weeklytitle">Introduction to Python & OOP</span></h2>
  <p class="intro">
      This week went by so quickly. Starting the computer science portion was a little intimidating but I've played with Python before and we did really well in labs so I wasn't too worried. This week we learned some Python fundamentals and explored object oriented programming. We also got our app onto our own domain: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://flexlog.app">FlexLog.app</a> and I scored my first interview since I began applying post career coach endorsement. ðŸ’ª </p>

            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1 & 2: </span> <span class="day">Introduction to Python I
              </span></h4>
              <p> Over the first two days we explored all sorts of Python features and syntax. We met our instructor, Beej Jorgensen, and our new pm groups. Beej has a pretty cool style where he really focuses his lectures on the questions that are asked and just explores the material and what could be without following a strict pattern. It's nice to know that we are able to learn on our own and make the lectures meet our needs at this point. Although I do wish we had some more examples for certain portions, there's nothing I can't look up or clarify through asking questions. This is a big point of emphasis in lecture and I can see why. I completed most of the assignment on day one and left a bit for myself to do the next day. The following day we got into classes and some file manipulation. Although it felt a bit overwhelming I reminded myself that this was normal when learning any new language and pushed forward.</p>

              <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3 & 4: </span> <span class="day">Introduction to Python II
                </span></h4>
                <p> For the next two days we were given another 2-day project, this one was to create a text based adventure game using OOP and Python. Simple right? ðŸ˜… Once I got started on the project what seemed like a long list of tasks started to get cut down one by one and it started to seem more manageable. I would get stuck on some syntax errors or the familiar typos but I felt like I understood what was going on for the most part. I know that the more reps I put in the clearer this will all become. On day 2 we started to dive deeper into OOP, came up with a bunch of examples of how to use OOP and learned how to inherit and override methods between class objects.</p>

                <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5: </span> <span class="day">Introduction to Python Sprint Challenge
                  </span></h4>
                  <p> Today's Sprint Challenge was pretty straightforward while still implementing some problem solving by throwing in new Python features that we have not used before. I was able to use my notes, some Google-Fu, and the Python docs to reach MVP. I did get stuck for a bit when reading content from a CSV file but I caught my error and everything made sense again. All in all a very fun week of Python.</p>

            <p class="weeklyp"> Beyond just learning Python this was also a fun week because we got our domain for our labs project up. You can check it out at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://flexlog.app">FlexLog.app</a>! Also I scheduled my first job interview after getting my career coach's endorsement and have a few other applications out in the wild. Let's see how this goes! Next week the topic in CS is algorithms. ðŸ˜…</p>
