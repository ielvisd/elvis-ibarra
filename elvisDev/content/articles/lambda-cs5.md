  <p class="intro">
      Build week was awesome. I had the chance to work as a team leader for a data science + web hybrid project using a Fifa 19 API. It was a great experience to work with other developers again and to experience a new role. It was a big task to put together a project in one week that was functional and had a data science component but our group had great communication and were commited to having a quality product by the end of the week. Our app is called Fifa Stronger Links and its purpose is to analyze teams in Fifa 19 & make recommendations to upgrade your team based on the "weakest link" theory. By demo day we had finished all the endpoints and were displaying a metric called the `Over Valued Ratio` for every player in Fifa 19. In the following weeks we plan on adding futher functionality for a recommendation engine to optimize your team by removing your most over-valued player(s). I'm excited to keep working with this group and to continue learning more CS in the upcoming weeks. I've also been applying to jobs and looking for that first opportunity out of Lambda School.   </p>

              </span></h4>
              <p>I had met this group the previous Friday and from that first meeting I could tell that this was going to be a great week. We had our first stand-up Monday morning and began to plan out our app and develop a gameplan. As team lead I was responsible for setting up all the repos, managing daily stand-ups, creating our Trello board, reviewing and merging pull requests to `master` branches, managing deploys, and overall management of the team. I made it a point to communicate with every team member and ensure that I was available for questions, pair programming or as a resource throughout the process.</p>
              <p>The toughest part of making this app was that our project lacked a wireframe and that it had a data science component on top of that. It took us awhile to decide on an minimum viable product (MVP) that our team would be happy with at the end of the week. Once we agreed on a MVP our front-end and back-end had to work with mock/dummy data while the data science students ran their analysis. It was stressful to get it all together once the analysis was complete but after some debugging and some group zooms we were displaying what we wanted and had reached MVP.</p>
              <p>Our group still wants to add more functionality to this app now that our initial analysis/endpoints are complete and to improve upon our current iteration so that it could be useful to players of Fifa 19 and make for a nice portfolio piece.

                  <p>Our group volunteered to present to the rest of the build week cohort and it was a great point of pride to see how far this group has come from even just a couple of hours ago. We got a great reaction from the instrutors and people who were soccer fans in the audience. After the demo we met for a retrospective where we discusssed what we accomplished, what we learned, what went well, and what our next steps will be. The group had a very positive experience and we are plannning on working together over the next few weeks to polish the app up. </p>

            <p class="weeklyp">Another great learning experience doing something I've never done before at Lambda School. I really appreciate my team for working well together and contributing to a nice fun app. I've learned some good lessons this week and I can't wait to give the app some polish, apply to more roles as a full stack engineer and start learning some C this upcoming week as we wrap up the CS curriculum.  âš½</p>
