      <p class="intro">
        Writing this blog is has been a great way for me to either prepare for a sprint (I'll start writing Wednesday or Thursday) or review what I've just learned (I'll start writing Thursday or Friday). This week was the latter, and I definitely needed it. We started the back-end portion of the curriculum which means we started to learn about what happens on the server side of the client-server relationship. It was a bit like learning how a magician does his tricks. For our sprint this week we built an API (Application Programming Interface) that performs CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations on a pre-built data access layer.  </p>

      <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1: </span> <span class="day">Introduction to Node.js and Express
        </span></h4>
        <p>
          Monday was another fresh start as we started to dive into the back-end portion of the curriculum. It's never a dull day at LambdaSchool. We met our third instructor and started to get into new material right away. We began to learn how to use Node.js as a platform to write server code that can communicate with clients (other computers) using JavaScript. On top of that we brought in Express which is a web application framework atop Node.js that lets us add routing and middleware. A lot to digest for one day but our instructor was really patient and gave us great code-along demos. We started a 2-day project whose day 1 objective was to successfully implement a GET request. I was feeling tired but solid on the instruction and the project by the end of the day.  </p>

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2: </span> <span class="day">Server-side Routing
          </span></h4>
        <p> In day 2 we delved deeper into Express and saw how it gave our application a way to handle different URL+HTTP method combinations. We used it to send requests that manipulated the data on our server in different ways. We used Postman as a tool to manually test our requests which was valuable when it came time to do our projects this week. We also saw how to read data from the query string, request body and route parameters. It always seems like a mountain of content at first but the instruction and the projects help bring it all together in a digestible way. I'm lucky to be able to put in the time to do the work. That is one thing that is necessary to be successful. You have to be fully committed. That being said I was able to finish this 2 day project and whip up a quick React app to view the posts that my server was spinning up. We're moving fast. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Express Middleware</span></h4>
        <p>This day focused on using middleware to extend the features that were provided by the Express framework. I enjoyed that our instructor demoed how to write custom middleware which made it easy to understand what Express was doing under the hood. We started another 2 day project which had us practicing more endpoint routing and writing our first custom middleware.

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Deployment and Good Practices</span></h4>
        <p>As I write this I'm impressed at how much we've covered in one week. On the fourth day of instruction we saw how to use error handling middleware, learned how to use Express Router to organize our code (which made my server file a lot cleaner and shorter) and deployed to Heroku. All in a day's work. Once again I was able to finish this 2-day project on time and wrapped it in a presentational React app to display a portion of our data. I thought the next day's Sprint would be straight forward... I probably should've studied or written this recap earlier. </p>

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 11 - Node-Express</span></h4>
          <p>For the sprint this week we were tasked with creating an API that performed CRUD operations on two data sets that were pre-built for us. (Sprints are only 3 hours long). I struggled getting a 404 request to return when I wanted it to, had I learned anything at all? I was stumped. And hungry. I reached out to my project manager and let her know that I wouldn't be finishing my Sprint on time but would debug and submit after lunch. As I was eating I had my lightbulb moment! I was expecting something of my method that it couldn't do and had actually solved a similar problem earlier in the week. I got home, debugged my code and submitted my project. Mission accomplished. </p>
        </div>
      <p class="weeklyp">After my one-on-one with my project manager I felt relieved to hear that I wasn't the only one in my cohort to have had that issue with the Sprint. I'm amazed every week at the new skills we learn. Next up, we add data persistence to our web APIs. </p>
