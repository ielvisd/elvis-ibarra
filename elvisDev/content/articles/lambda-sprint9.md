    <p class="intro">
      As a wrap up (content-wise) topic to the front-end portion of the Lambda School Full Stack Web Development
      Curriculum we explored Redux in week 9. Redux is a state management system that can be used in conjunction with
      React to develop large scale applications. Its uses are to provide your application with a single source of truth
      without having to worry about passing state around from component to component like we were last week. As I write
      this week's post I am working on fixing my Sprint project (my Smurfs needed a reload to show) but overall it was
      another week full of new content and fun breakthroughs. ß</p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">Redux Fundamentals I</span></h4>
        <p>
          Ok, now that my Sprint project is fixed I can finish my weekly blog post. On Monday we were introduced to
          Redux and it was definitely a lot of information but the project was manageable and after asking a cohort
          member for some help with one part of my code I was done with the first project and had begun to setup the
          next day's project. At this point I had an idea of what Redux was and how to use it but was still iffy on
          some of the basics such as the difference between the Redux state tree and the React component states. These
          concepts cleared up with some more practice on days 2-5. </p>

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">Redux Fundamentals II
          </span></h4>
        <p>On day 2 we explored how Redux is based on the immutability (don't mess with data) principle and the
          methods/techniques we can use to take advantage of Redux's state tree. Our project was to re-create a project
          we had completed before but using Redux, this was a to-do list app. I didn't finish on time but this project
          was the one that started to clear things up. I didn't finish because I was mixing up component state and my
          redux state. After some research I came across a GitHup post where Redux's creator is addressing this exact
          topic and explaining the differences and when to use which. It was great to see the main developer involved
          in his project and helping others out who are trying to use his technology. I started to see the
          possibilities with Redux and how smooth it could be. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Async Redux - Redux Thunk I</span></h4>
        <p>
          This was a powerful day. We learned about middleware in Redux that lets you do things to actions before they
          hit the reducer, which, in turn, let you do asynchronous calls in your applications. We rebuilt another
          previous application today which interacted with a Star Wars server and returned some characters. I got this
          project done on time which was a great relief from the day before and gave me a confidence boost in learning
          Redux.

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Async Redux - Redux Thunk II</span></h4>
        <p>The last day of instruction for the week and we explored asynchronous calls in more detail. We rebuilt yet
          another application we had worked on before but this time there was no pre-provided code so we had to whip up
          the whole thing from scratch. This was a pretty cool experience and it definitely prepared me for the next
          day's Sprint challenge. I didn't finish what I wanted to on time but I got the bulk of the project done.</p>

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 9 - Redux Smurfs</span></h4>
        <p>After a week of re-working projects it was only appropriate to re-work a prior Sprint as well. We were
          tasked with building a React/Redux application that interfaced with a Smurfs API asynchronously. I finished
          on time but didn't have the functionality I wanted. I hit some stretch goals with deletion but still haven't
          mastered an edit feature. After spending some time today looking at my code I fixed my mistake which involved
          not passing a dispatch correctly when adding a Smurf which caused me to have to reload the page to se my new
          list. Fixing this cleared up many things and it's always a good idea to check out the solution to the Sprint
          after you pass to see what you could've improved. </p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp">The major difference I noticed in how I worked this week compared to last was that I was less
        flustered when I didn't get something right way. I remembered a theme during the after hours lecture which is
        that the code is doing precisely what I told it to do and that each error has a meaning and a purpose.
        Sometimes it may be tough to find out just what that is but that is our job as programmers. This made redux
        issues more enjoyable and the learning process a lot smoother this week. Next week is project week which means
        our last week with our 2nd instructor and another week-long project where we get to display all we've learned
        so far.</p>
