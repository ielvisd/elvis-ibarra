                  <p class="intro">
                    It’s been 3 months since I got hired as a Frontend Engineer at Joymode and I wanted to recap how it’s been, what
                    I’ve learned and what I’m looking forward to working on in the near future. Going into this role I knew that Joymode
                    iterated quickly and was a very dynamic environment. Having gone through Lambda School I felt comfortable with rapid
                    change and the flexiblity that's required to make adjustments on the fly. Inded every month has felt different than
                    the last which for me feels right at home and that’s a perfect way to split up this recap:
                  </p>
                  <div class="top-content">
                    <div class="text-content">
                      <h4><span class="daytags">Month 1 </span> <span class="day">Learning the Ropes, Joining the Team
                        </span></h4>
                      <div class="mb-4 mt-4 w-4/5 m-auto" >
                      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1475506631979-72412c606f4d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1500&q=80" alt="Tabletop soccer"></img></div>
                      <p>I have a notepad where I write things down that I want to remember, things I plan on doing and a reflection on how the day went. This makes writing this recap out a bit simpler but even so the first couple of weeks at
                        Joymode were definitely memorable and not something I’ll soon forget. Part of the orientation process was to
                        have coffee meetings with various team members throughout the company. This was a great way to get to know
                        people as well as get some insight as to their role and how I could help. From the beginning I felt welcomed and
                        was given clear assignments and value. I definitely felt like I had found the right environment to start my dev
                        career.
                      </p>
                      <p>On day one I was able to push a change to production. Although it was a fairly minor copy change I appreciated
                        being brought into the fold immediately and seeing my impact from the jump. The frontend framework used for the
                        Joymode website is Vue.js. I had only used Vue a handful of times prior to working at Joymode but I was
                        confident in my ability to quickly learn and contribute. It’s pretty cool and I’m still learning something new
                        every day.
                      </p>
                      <p>Another big part of the orientation process was working at the warehouse for a few days and trying on different
                        roles. It was a great way to see the company from many different perspectives and meet even more people. For a
                        couple of days I serviced products, prepared bundles, made deliveries, & onboarded products. It was definitely
                        the complete experience and I was excited to join such a dynamic company with so many different moving parts.
                      </p>
                      <p>Throughout this month I learned more about the codebase, the work environment, team schedule, testing, event
                        tracking & code style guidelines. I was able to work on new landing page, the introduction of Premium bundles to
                        the website and helped implement a new split test. I started to get comfortable with weekly sprints and the pace
                        at which things moved.
                      </p>

                    <div class="text-content">
                      <h4><span class="daytags">Month 2 </span> <span class="day">Testing & Trust
                        </span></h4>
                    <div class="mb-4 mt-4 w-4/5 m-auto" >

                      <p>The second month at Joymode was definitely much different than the first. I started to see how quickly things
                        change at a startup and also began to take on larger projects. One of my assignments was to fix some end to end
                        tests that were working in development but failing during production (features were still functioning, but the
                        production tests were failing). I’ll spare the details but it was incredibly rewarding to tackle this project
                        and be able to get those tests to pass. I got very used to asking questions and began to pair program with
                        others on the team. It really helps to be able to talk through code with fellow developers in order to clear up
                        and enhance one’s own mental model of the codebase.
                      </p>
                      <p>One thing I love about Joymode is that I always feel like I’m a valuable part of the team. Whether it’s stand
                        ups, engineering syncs, strategy meetings or one on ones with my PM I always feel like I have a voice which is
                        really awesome. This month I started to feel like I was being trusted with larger tasks and I also had my first
                        work from home day. It was great, I was able to code from the house and went to get a new contact lens
                        prescription during lunch. Up until this point I hadn’t done any work from home days since I was still getting
                        used to the workflow and the environment but I felt comfortable with the tasks I had for this sprint just made
                        sense with the appointment.
                      </p>
                      <p>I also received my first full page assignment this month which was definitely a bit more complex than what I
                        had been given up until now. I had a few moments where I felt like I was doing something completely wrong but
                        after reviewing my own work and taking a weekend to organize my to-do list I was able to finish the new page
                        (which hasn’t launched yet) and was re-energized. I was also injured most of this month and a bit of the
                        previous month with a bad MCL sprain from training jiu jitsu which shouldn’t have affected me as much as it did
                        but it was definitely annoying having to limp around everywhere and not be able to train. I think this
                        contributed to me not feeling as organized as I normally am but luckily it was nothing major and everyone in the
                        office was really nice about it.

                        </span></h4>

                      <p>This is definitely what I signed up for. Month 3 was definitely completely different than months 1 and 2. I’m
                        communicating with more members of the team as my tickets have grown in complexity and have upgraded to a sweet
                        4 monitor setup 🤩. I’m getting better about writing tests for my code and am definitely feeling in the flow of
                        things as far as adding features & changes to the site. There’s definitely never a lack of challenges to tackle
                        here and it’s nice to be given to green light to try new things, make improvements or tackle existing issues.
                      </p>
                      <p>I’m always looking for ways to improve and things to maximize my flow state and in this 3rd month I’ve
                        definitely found things that work for me. Some tips and tricks for making your dev life easier:
                      </p>
                      <ul class="dev-tips" style="list-style-type:disc;">
                        <li class="dev-tip">
                          <span class="bold">Exercise.</span> I fell in love with jiu-jitsu a little over 2 years ago and train
                          regularly a few times a week. It’s something that definitely helps keep me active and is a great way to clear
                          your mind.
                        </li>
                        <li class="dev-tip">
                          <span class="bold">Music.</span> I definitely code better when I’m listening to some instrumental background
                          music. I can’t do anything with lyrics and podcasts are too distracting unless the work I’m doing is really
                          straightforward.
                        </li>
                        <li class="dev-tip">
                          <span class="bold">Breaks.</span> I start to get less focused after the 45-min to 1 hour mark and I definitely
                          have to take a walk or play with my dogs for a bit before getting back to it. The Pomodoro method is effective
                          as well.
                        </li>
                        <li class="dev-tip">
                          <span class="bold">Pair-programming.</span> Working with someone else helps me cement my own understanding and
                          I’m constantly pickup up cool things from my fellow programmers.
                        </li>
                        <li class="dev-tip">
                          <span class="bold">Side projects.</span> I love working at Joymode but I definitely try to find space to work
                          on my own ideas and projects. I plan on someday having a workable online jiu-jitsu training notebook <a
                            href="https://www.jiujits.io">jiujitsio</a> & am debugging and in the process of making this Bitcoin Clock
                          tick <a href="https://www.bitcointime.date">Bitcoin Time</a>. Working on smaller side projects allows me to
                          experiment and try things in a somewhat safer environment and you learn really quickly when trying to build
                          something from scratch.
                        </li>
                        <li class="dev-tip">
                          <span class="bold">Networking.</span> I don’t do enough of this but I am trying to be out there more and be an
                          active member of the local dev community. You can learn a lot just be seeing what others are building and you
                          never know what resources you have in your local community.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p class="weeklyp">Overall I’m incredibly grateful and lucky to have found this team and am excited for what’s
                      ahead. There are lots of cool things that we have been working on that will launch in the near future that I am
                      looking forward to seeing go live. See ya next time! ✌️ </p>
