<section class="weekly">
  <p class="intro">
      This week I moved to be the TA for CS17's second sprint group which meant that I gave the Algorithms guided projects again which made it a smooth week. I also spent some time this week practicing whiteboarding problems as preparation for coding interviews and assessments. </p>

          <p> Since I had just done these guided projects (for Algorithms) the previous week I was able to focus on making adjustments where things didn't go quite as planned the first time around. The best change I implemented was using Repl.it multiplayer to engage the students and allow them more "hands on keyboards" time and have them answer my questions by typing some code out themselves. It helped keep my group engaged and I'm happy with how these week's guided projects turned out.  </p>
  </div>
  <p class="weeklyp"> I also had a couple of interviews and finished (as much as I could) getting JiuJitsio ready for the final day of the Lambda/Pioneer contest. It's not functional yet but it's nice having a project I can keep working on and watch it grow as it's in line with my favorite hobby so I doubt it'll ever by truly done =) </p>
