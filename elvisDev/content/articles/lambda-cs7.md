<section class="weekly">
  <p class="intro">
      Nice week, starting to get the hang of the C language and am learning something new everyday. This week we learned a bit about the history of computers & programming while at the same time implementing arrays & hash tables in C. While I am looking for my first opportunity as I wrap up my time at Lambda School; I did go ahead and apply to be a PM for CS17 which starts at the same time as my final week in CS. Reviewing CS topics & helping others along the way while I transition to a full-time role is the current plan. I'm excited about all the possibilities in front of me and look forward to what's coming next.  </p>

            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1 & 2: </span> <span class="day">Theory of Computation & Arrays
              </span></h4>
              <p> Very interesting to hear about the history of computers, programming and how computers work at their most basic level. I feel like this was a very eye-opening week and I'm feeling more and more confident with my C skills and the ability to learn any computer language put in front of me. We had a 2-day assignment where we needed to implement arrays & array functionality in C. After going through the training kit & reviewing some videos from previous lectures I was able to complete the assignment.  </p>

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3 & 4: </span> <span class="day">Hash Tables
            </span></h4>
            <p> The next 2 days had us talking about hash tables and why they are the single most important structure known to mankind. They are powerful because their read, write & insertion time is O(1) due to the nature of having key/value pairs stored in an object where the index of each entry is the hashed function's output of that key. If that sounds like a lot, don't worry, just know that they are awesome and being able to impement one in C has been one of the most satisifying things I've done so far. I felt like these past few weeks have been challenging/busy but it's nice to see things come together, even if it's just a HW assignment =)  </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5: </span> <span class="day">Sprint: Theory of Computation & Hash Tables
          </span></h4>
          <p> This was the first Sprint where we had to answer questions live as part of an interview with a random PM. It definitely helped me prepare knowing that I had to communicate my knowledge to another human being instead of just completing a coding challenge. It was a nice twist. The project itself had us work on some Boolean Algebra problems and then some exercises where we needed to solve problems with hash tables in C. It feels really great to be able to take what you've done during the week and then solve a completely new problem with those tools at the end of it. I was able to get through the core of the Sprint with a 2 (passing) and am going to go back and try the extra problem for a 3 over the weekend.

            <p class="weeklyp">Excited to go deep next week and get into computer Architecture after a successful week. I also have a fun project to work on for the next few weeks! I signed up for Lambda School/Pioneer's April tournament where you work on a project for a month and the top 5 students get a $2000/month 9-month living stipend. I have an idea for a jiu-jitsu app I want to work on and it would make a fun portfolio piece if nothing else. See ya next week! </p>
