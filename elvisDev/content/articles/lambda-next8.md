  <p class="intro">
      This week the students in my CS TA group were working through the 'Theory of Computation / Hash Tables' Sprint and my webPT 4 group is working through the "Building RESTful web API's with Express and Node.js" Sprint so it's definitely been busy trying to keep all my content straight but appreciate all the review and reps that I'm getting right now. The `Theory of Computation / Hash Table` Sprint is really interesting. Implementing arrays and hash tables in C really helps shine a light into the importance of this data structure and what is going on under the hood in many methods/data structures we see in higher level languages. To close the week out remember that on-site interview I went on last week? Well I was offered the position! I'm happy to announce that I will be joining the Joymode team as a Front-End Engineer starting in July! It's been a long journey but from day one I knew I was making the right decision when I applied to Lambda and couldn't be happier to join Joymode and take this next step in my journey.  </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Week: </span> <span class="day">TA for CS17 (Theory of Computation / Hash Tables), webPT4 (RESTful Web APIs with Express and Node.js) & Hello Joymode!
          </span></h4>
          <p>Next week will be my last week as a Lambda TA as I prep for my new role at Joymode and I can't put into words how much I appreciate being given this opportunity not only to TA but to be part of Lambda at all. I could not have asked for a better experience. It has been an amazing time of my life. I've never learned so much in such a small amount of time. If you're on the fence about Lambda I can't recommend it enough. </p>
          <p>I'm starting as a Front-End Engineer with Joymode in July and am really excited. I can't wait to join this amazing team. During my on-site I was blown away by how friendly everyone was, the collaborative environment and the company vision/mission. I'm excited to not only jump into a new tech stack but be part of a company that I know is doing something special.</p>
          <p>I posted this in the #hired channel on Lambda's Slack and could go on and on about how great Lambda is, if you ever have questions about the school or my experience feel free to reach out.</p>

  <p class="weeklyp"> Thanks again Lambda, friends & family. I appreciate all of you and am looking forward to joining the Joymode and seeing what comes next.</p>
