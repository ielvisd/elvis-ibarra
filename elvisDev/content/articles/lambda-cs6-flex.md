  <p class="intro">
      Since I was busy last week working on a project for a potential employer, I started the week in Flex working on 'Intro to C' one more time. This time I was in a smaller group reviewing the material and working on the same projects I was supposed to complete last week. This was really nice! My instructor Luisan is very knowledgable and I get a chance to ask more questions in the smaller group. I'm really thankful that Lambda has this as part of the program and I can pickup right where I left off. I felt a lot more prepared having heard the lectures once before and had fun working through the various C assignments this week. I also had 2 phone screens and 3 short coding challenges this week. Definitely feels like things are moving in the right direction. </p>

            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1 & 2: </span> <span class="day">Intro to C
              </span></h4>
              <p> Over these two days we covered the basics of C starting with a bit of history and discussion over it's importance in computer science. We then began to cover some usage including how to include header files, basic types, arrays, strings, flow control & functions. We were given a two day assignment and I had some good momentum going into day 2. I was extra excited because I was able to schedule 2 phone screens that morning. The following day we continued our dicussion of C and began to learn about the memory model and how pointers work. We explored structs and dynamic memory. It was a lot to take in over two days but having seen it once helped a lot. I was almost done with the first assignment by the end of day 2 but since I was preparing for phone screens on Tuesday & Wednesday I didn't complete this project until the following day. </p>

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3 & 4: </span> <span class="day">Processes and System Calls
            </span></h4>
            <p> For days 3 and 4 we had another 2-day project covering processes and system calls such as pipe() and fork(). Using these system calls lets us take great control over our programs and it felt really powerful to be programming this "close to the metal". It was really interesting to learn what was going on under the hood and I felt a great appreciation for the language and how computers and programs operate in general. I mostly finished the project and felt prepared for the Sprint.  </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5: </span> <span class="day">Sprint: Intro to C & Processes
          </span></h4>
          <p> This week's Sprint challenged us to write an application in C that printed out a directory listing & size for the directory that the user specifies on the command line. At first this seemed a bit intimidating but after reading the instructions I was able to pull my knowledge of C syntax, a computer's memory model, structs and system calls to finish MVP before the end of the 3 hours. It felt great after not having time to work on these topics last week to successfully complete the assignments and pass the Sprint.

            <p class="weeklyp">This was a really fun and interesting week. I used to be intimdated about learning Computer Science but I'm confident approaching/learnign new material and have really grown since I started training jiu-jitsu and since I started Lambda School. With each interview/code challenge I get more confident and I'm very excited for what's to come.  </p>
