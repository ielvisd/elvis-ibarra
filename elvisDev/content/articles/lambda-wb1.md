<p class="intro">
Just a short update this week as we are on break for the holidays.</p>
  <div class="top-content">
      <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Week 1:</span> <span class="day">Updating Lambda Notes w/Authentication</span></h4>
                  <p> This week I worked on updating my Lambda Notes project to have working authentication that would show only the notes belonging to the logged-in user. I ran into many roadblocks but was able to power through and get things working after dropping in and out of the code over the week. The last thing I want to add to this project other than a final styling and responsiveness check is the ability for users to share notes with each other. Once I implement that I can move on to studying some Python and maybe dabbling with some Vue.

        <p class="weeklyp">I also want to start applying to some jobs to see what's out there and start exploring the opportunities I see. See you next week! =)
