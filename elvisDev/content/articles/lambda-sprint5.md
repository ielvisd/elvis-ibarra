<section class="weekly">
    <p class="intro">This was my first Project Week as a Lambda School student. Project Week is a 4 day Sprint where
      you are working on your own to complete a project by a Thursday afternoon deadline. You are expected to use all
      of the skills and lessons given during the first 4 weeks to successfully complete the project. There were many
      pieces to the project and plenty of additional tasks to complete if you finished ahead of schedule. We were
      tasked with creating a full website with multiple pages and responsiveness for different devices. It needed
      multiple user interface functionalities that needed to work in order for the project to be considered
      successful. It was an intimidating task but I knew it was possible because there wasn't anything new other than
      doing everything we've done all in one project instead of one a small part where pieces are provided. This was
      all us from scratch other than some design files and styles. The project theme was an architectural design firm
      - <a class="text-blue-700" href="/projects/sj-associates">S&J Associates<a> - website, we were tasked with a mobile and desktop design of the home page and a desktop design for
        the services page plus the header navigation and the tab navigator in the services page. The above link will take you
        to my completed project.  </a>
      <div class="top-content">
        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">Project Setup and High Hopes</span></h4>
          <p>This was the day I started to outline my project and decided to go with a mobile first approach to
            challenge myself as every project we had done in the past was desktop first. I'
        m talking about whether you design your mobile or desktop first which affects how the view adjusts across
        devices. I printed and marked up my designs with HTML tags, organized my files, forked and cloned the Github
        project repository, built a Trello board with MVP (the essential items needed to get accomplished, 5 total) and
        stretch goals and started coding my mobile desktop page right after lunch. I finished the day with the mobile
        page about halfway finished. I felt confident that I could get most of the project done the following day but
        was a bit nervous that others (a small amount, but still) in my group had finished all of the main tasks in
        this one day.</p> </div> <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">The Main Page Mobile and Desktop Versions Take
            Shape </span></h4>
        <p>On this second day I struggled to finish the mobile and desktop pages by the end of the day. I truly
          appreciated the complexity of the design files we were given and also my own lack of practice in creating
          websites and using the tools at my disposal. I loved re-learning some things I had just done a few weeks
          ago and solidifying some of that knowledge that I had only recently gained. Even though I was done with 2/5
          tasks I now felt like I was falling behind but was pretty sure that I could finish the project with the 2
          days I had left but wasn't so sure that I could get it done by the following day anymore.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Services Desktop is Finished and I Get Stuck Trying
              to Get My Navigation Overlay to Close</span></h4>
          <p>A breakthrough day for me. I finished most of my HTML and LESS for all the sites at all the breakpoints
            necessary for MVP and I started to focus on building the two functional Javascript components. I mostly
            finished one where the user clicks on the navigation and an overlay menu opens and then it closes when the
            user clicks the X. Sounds simple but I got stuck not getting the overlay to close and went to sleep
            dreaming about solutions. I found one as I was drifting to bed but was reminded of it the following day. I
            knew I had the whole day to implement a functional component that I had succesfully done in the past and to
            debug my almost done main navigator. I was 80% confident I would finish the project at all by the deadline.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Pulling it All Together and Demo Day </span></h4>
          <p>I woke up and got right to coding knowing that at 2pm was Demo Time. I reached out to my Project Manager
            and told her of my progress and said that I might have to have a video conference to talk through my issue
            if I couldn't debug it myself. She gave me a nice tip on how she solved it and it sparked an aha moment of
            my thought the previous night. Once I got that fixed the remaining navigation component went quick and I
            finished the MVP tasks with a few hours to spare. I got it reviewed and after a quick modification I was
            good to go on trying some stretch tasks before final submittal. I was relieved and proud of myself for
            sticking with it and finishing on time.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="weeklyp">Now that project week is over and we have a 3-day weekend to reflect and look ahead I'm
          thankful
          and grateful for this experience. In 5 weeks I have a project on my own domain which I created with the
          skills that
          I picked up in a very short amount of time. Some of my classmates have some really incredible work which I'm
          super
          proud of and inspired by. Demo day was a good time to learn and see what's possible with more time and
          patience.
          Next week we begin to learn React and I am still planning on fixing some things on my S&J Architects page as
          well
          as getting around to implementing the tab navigator on this page and adding a Projects page to display S&J
          Associates. I also need to fix the mobile view of this page. See you next week if not sooner.</p>
