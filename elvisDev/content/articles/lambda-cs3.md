        <h2><span class="cs14">CS15</span> Week 3 - <span class="weeklytitle">Data Structures</span></h2>
    <p class="intro">
        This was a nice week diving deep into data structures that are found across languages. We explored linked lists, queues, binary search trees and heaps. We also learned methods to analyze the complexity of algorithms that make up the methods associated with these data structures. While it was definitely a complex week the fact that we had a 4-day project this time around helped space the concepts out and allowed us to focus on each data structure at a good pace. I also had my first interview since joining Lambda School and was lucky enough to pickup <a class="text-pink-700" href="https://elvis.dev">elvis.devðŸ”¥!</a> </p>

              <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1, 2, 3 & 4: </span> <span class="day">Data Structures
                </span></h4>
                <p>Over the course of 4 days we learned about liked lists, queues, binary search trees and heaps among other data structures. We saw how to code each of these from scratch and the CRUD methods associated with each. Towards the end of the week we saw how these data structures can be used and built from each other and that's when everything started to click. Conceptually I feel strong after this week but I'm definitely going to spend some more time practicing these fundamental concepts. I'm also getting more and more comfortable with whiteboarding challenges with each passing week. We also spent a good amount of time optimizing our code and analyzing time and space complexities of different algorithms associated with each structure.  </p>               <p>I love how there is a big focus at Lambda School around learning and asking questions. The instructors trust us to explore and become self sufficient by the time we are near graduation. I finished MVP for this project on day 3 and spent most of day 4 reviewing and finishing some more cover letters and applications. </p>

                  <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5: </span> <span class="day">Data Structures Sprint Challenge
                    </span></h4>
                    <p>The Sprint Challenge this week was interesting; it made good use of a Lambda function which deepened my appreciation and understanding of the Python language. We were tasked with writing an algorithm to traverse a binary search tree, optimizing some code, and analyzing the time and space complexities from our first 2 tasks. I used up the entire Sprint time to finish but I was confident with my responses.  </p>
                    <p>After meeting with my PM to discuss my solutions and a post sprint lecture by our instructor I felt good about the week and am excited to start studying and prepping for Graphs next week</p>

              <p class="weeklyp">I'm excited to have landed <a class="text-pink-700"  href="https://elvis.dev">elvis.devðŸ”¥!</a> when the `.dev` domains went on sale and am super pumped about all the exciting companies/opportunties that I'm applying to now that I've been endorsed by my career coach at Lambda School. Super excited to see what materializes in the coming weeks. ðŸ’ª.</p>
