<section class="weekly">
  <p class="intro">
      It's been a busy past two weeks! So busy in fact that this is actually the first time that I've skipped a weekly blog post since starting at Lambda. One late day turned into another and here we are two weeks later and no update. Well, I'm back! What have I been up to? Career follow-ups, leading and prepping for Guided Projects in Python and this week I transitioned from a PM to a TA for webPT4 and led the intro to Redux. I couldn't ask for a better environment to practice my skills and keep sharp while I continue to look for my first role out of Lambda. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Week: </span> <span class="day">TA for CS17 (Data Structures & Graphs), webPT4 (Intro to Redux) & Career Work
          </span></h4>
          <p> For CS17 the first week was Data Structures and the second week was Graphs. I've been trying to make use of Repl.it multiplayer as much as possible to get the students engaged and it does a really great job of allowing students to express themselves and get more hands on keyboards practice during the demos. I can't talk enough about how much I appreciate the extra practice I get as a TA. My understanding of the material and my skills as a developer have increased tremendously since starting this role and I appreciate having a look at how the instructors prepare the material and how much effort they put into making this the best learining experience possible and to ensure that every student leaves Lambda Schools with the skills needed to be a world class engineer. I'm learning something new everyday and enjoy seeing students have that aha moment or help them through some tough material. </p>
  </div>
  <p class="weeklyp"> This upcoming week is Build Week for my group which should free me up to focus on some career items that I've been putting off and there may be a change in my TA role but that's to be announced/determined. Next weekend I'm joining up with a friend from Lambda to do the Zeit hackathon so watch out for updates from that! </p>
