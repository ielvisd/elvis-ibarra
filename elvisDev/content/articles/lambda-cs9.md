  <p class="intro">
      This was the last week of CS instruction and, as it turns out, was my last week as a Lambda student altogether! It's bittersweet to be at this moment but I couldn't be more thankful to everyone at Lambda and am excited for what's next. First a recap of the final week where we used all of our skills and knowledge from previous Sprints to revisit web servers, this time in C. </p>
      <div class="top-content">
        <div class="text-content">
            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1 & 2: </span> <span class="day">Web Servers I - Protocols, Sockets & HTTP
              </span></h4>
              <p> This week really helped paint a picture of how the web servers work and was a great final challenge. We had a week long project where we implemented our own web server in C. On days 1 & 2 we learned about protocols such as TCP & UDP, the sockets API and HTTP. In short, we learned how data is transferred over the internet. I pair programmed most of the week which was helpful. I probably should have done more pair programming sooner in Lambda but I'm glad that I started to do so when I did.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3 & 4: </span> <span class="day">Web Servers II - Mime Types & LRU cache
            </span></h4>
            <p> To wrap up we learned about MIME types, LRU cache & general career advice. In order for your browser to know what to with the data it receives it needs to know what type of data it is. MIME types are used for this reason. I was able to get my server to display different file types with this change to the code. We also learned about the LRU (Least Recently Used) cache which is one way to keep your recently accessed pages in a cache for faster retrieval. We used a hash table with a doubly linked list written in C to do our gets and puts to the cache. It was a tough two days of coding but we got it done and I felt nervous and anxious for a final tough Sprint. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5: </span> <span class="day">Sprint: A Simple cURL-like Client
          </span></h4>
          <p> This sprint challenges us to implement a barebones client that could make requests to servers in C. After reading the instructions and inspecting the code I was off to a good start on the sprint. At some point I had an interview with a PM who asked me questions on the content and I passed that portion of the Sprint. After inspecting the code I started to pseudocode my way to the solution. Then I implemented my actual solution. After mixing up some variables and general debugging I was able to get my code to display web pages. Pretty cool! I then went to test my server from the week and I realized that I didn't like how that output was being shown so I was able to fix some things on that project as well. Overall a very challenging sprint that took me into lunch to finish but I got it done and learned a lot this week. </p>
  </div>
  <p class="weeklyp"> I didn't even talk about my Pioneer/Lambda tournament entry or the fact that I have been asked to be the lead TA for CS17 starting on Monday! So many things happened this week. I decided on a name for the jiu-jitsu app I'm developing for the tournament. Jiujitsio! There is a landing page up at: <a class="text-pink-700" href="https://jiujits.io">jiujits.io</a> right now there isn't anything to do other than sign up but I plan on having some preliminary features done by next week, fully featured by the end of week 4 and a polish for week 5. It's really testing my ability to code in hurry. I can't wait to put more time into it.  </p>
  <p class="weeklyp"> While I continue to search for my first role out of Lambda I decided to apply to TA for CS17 which starts on Monday. TA is a bit different from my current PM position for webPT4 in that there are guided project(s) that I will be leading in the form of a live lecture daily for the entire CS curriculum. This is going to absolutely force me to learn the material at a deeper level and will be a great learning experience. I'm going to be spending some time this weekend reviewing Python to prepare for week 1.   </p>
  <p class="weeklyp"> Technically I still have a week left as a student which was a build week but I am going to participate in CS17's build week(s) as an instructor so I'll get that last one in when the time comes. Ultimately as the last blog post as a student I want to say thank you to all of the Lambda staff, students and community as well as to everyone in my life who has helped get me this far. I've learned a lot and so many doors and opportunities are open now because of this. I'm working on things I love and couldn't be more excited for the future. I'll keep you posted.   </p>
