  <p class="intro">
      Another mind-blowing week at Lambda School. This week was dedicated to understanding how computers work at a very low level. We practiced converting decimal, binary & hexadecimal numbers, explored the components of a computer, saw how useful a CPU stack was, learned to handle subroutines & implemented our own CPU emulator in C. I also had my first hour-long technical interview this week.  </p>

            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1 & 2: </span> <span class="day">Computer Architecture I - CPU components, decimals/binary/hex & bitwise operations
              </span></h4>
              <p> It's hard to believe that there's only 1 week of CS instruction left before my final week of the full stack web development curriculum. What a ride it's been. We started a 4-day project to program an 8-bit emulator that was Turing complete in C. While a lot of the project was built out for us it took me awhile to wrap my head around the project and all it's files. The lectures were really interesting and it was nice to get a deep dive into computer architecture. I spent most of the afternoon looking through the project spec and familiarizing myself with the documentation. By the end of the 2nd day I felt like I had started to understand all the pieces and was making progress through MVP.   </p>
              <p> I appreciated this week's lectures, I had never seen the decimal/binary/hex conversions and purposes explained so eloquently. It all started to click this week. I pair programmed with a friend from FSW14 day 1 and it was a great experience to problem solve together and hit MVP.   </p>

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3 & 4: </span> <span class="day">Computer Architecture II - CPU Stack, Subroutines & 1st Technical Interview
            </span></h4>
            <p> Days 3 and 4 were nice. I had finally begun to know how to work through this week's project and was starting to see how the CPU stack was being used in conjunction with the CPU counter. I saw how a computer moved through memory to call subroutines and began to see all the pieces work together. It was incredible to think that this program could open any file I gave it and as long as I defined the instructions it was capable of anything. A truly powerful feeling. </p> <p>  I had a technical interview Thursday morning which was the first one I'd been a part of. I think I did "OK" but know that I could have had a more elegant/optimal solution. I explained my thought process and was mostly able to implement the additional features I was asked to write. Either way this goes I would not be in this position had I not signed up for Lambda School.  </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5: </span> <span class="day">Sprint: Binary, Decimal, and Hex Conversion, and Implementation of Conditional Jumps
          </span></h4>
          <p> So today's Sprint took me a little longer to complete than I anticipated. Once I started to use some debugging techniques I learned in class and began to draw out how the program was supposed to work it was manageable to find a path forward. We were tasked with adding conditional jumps to our LS-8 emulator which was a challenging yet fair assessment of ours objectives for the week. We also had to answer some questions from a PM that related to the objectives and that was helpful as it is good practice for real interviews. Went a little bit over the time limit but managed to hit MVP and am looking forward to the weekend and spending some time building out my jiu-jitsu app.</p>

  <p class="weeklyp"> A very busy week but I'm really proud that I met MVP for the project and the Sprint. I also had a good experience with my first technical interview. I learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to these situations and know exactly what I need to review to improve next time. I got a chance to start my Pioneer project which was another nice accomplishment. It's going to be a jiu-jitsu app that will let the user track their sessions/drills/techniques & stats. I have the data model complete and have mapped out what the app and features will be. I've started to code it out and am making progress. This is fun!  </p>
