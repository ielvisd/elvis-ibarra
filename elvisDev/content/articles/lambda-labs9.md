      <p class="intro">
      Lambda Labs is a 5 week immersive capstone experience where I worked on a team with 4 other developers to create an app that tracks your fitness progress and scheduled workouts.</p>

                        <p> As part of Labs I kept a development journal which gives an in depth recap of everything that occured in Lambda Labs along with links to the project, code examples & whiteboard videos I recorded each week. <a class="text-pink-700" href="https://elvisibarra-labs9-journal.netlify.com/">Elvis Ibarra's FlexLog Development Journal</a>

              <p class="weeklyp">I'm writing this on Tuesday of the 5th week and it has been an amazing experience. During this time I was also able to re-do my resume with the help of my career coach. Check it out: <a class="text-pink-700" href="https://resume.creddle.io/resume/7br3kyyjls4">Elvis Ibarra's Resume</a> I'm excited to present our project demo on Friday and move on to CS & job applications.</p>
