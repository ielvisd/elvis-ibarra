  <p class="intro">
      What an exciting week! Started the month/weekend off by participating in the first ZEIT Hackathon with one of my teammates I worked on Flexlog with. Had a lot of fun making a ZEIT/Discord integration which notified you in your chosen channel of your ZEIT project deployments. Had a lot of fun building this and will go into more detail below. I also TA'd the intro to C portion of CS 17 for one of the groups and had a good time working through this portion of the curriculum through a new lens and getting extra reps with a low level language like C. I had an on-site interview with a company in Los Angeles on Tuesday that I'm excited about. I also went to my brother's high school graduation and capped the week off with a weekend of C, jiu-jitsu practice, and watching UFC 238. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Week: </span> <span class="day">ZEIT Hackathon, TA for CS17 (Intro to C), webPT4 (RESTful Web APIs with Express and Node.js) & Career Work
          </span></h4>
          <p>Participating in the ZEIT Hackathon was such a cool experience. At first I was a bit intimidated when I heard the idea from my teammate - a ZEIT/Discord integration that would alert you to ZEIT events in your chosen channel, all built with TypeScript (a language I hadn't used before) - in 48 hours. Not one to back down for my challenge I dove in. Such an awesome learning experience. My teammate showed me how to work with the new language and we got to work. Lots of practice reading docs and working collaboratively in a hurry. After countless Zoom sessions it was awesome to see the notification come through the channel during our demo video. Checkout the integration if you are interested: <a href="https://zeit.co/integrations/zcord">ZCORD</a>  </p>
          <p>On Tuesday I went to an on-site interview with a startup in Los Angeles. I had such a great time learning about the company, meeting the team, and working through coding exercises and a pair-programming session. I can't remember having a more pleasant interview experience. I feel really good about the process and am thankful to my career coaches and everyone at Lambda who has helped me prepare and get my skills to a level where I can confidently apply and be prepared to take on full stack software engineering roles. Excited for what's to come!   </p>
          <p>On the TA/Lambda side of things I spent most of my time working in C and making sure I was prepped for each guided project of the week. I'm having way more fun working in the language this second go around. Next week we go into the history of computing and hash tables in C. For the part-time cohort I'm going over backend material which I've been absent for this week with the interview & my brother's graduation falling on my guided project days.   </p>

  <p class="weeklyp">My brother's high school graduation was also this week on Thursday. He graduated from the same high school I did so it was so nice to see him walk the stage and give his graduation speech. He's worked really hard to set himself up for the future and I'm really proud of him. Wrapped up the weekend spending some time on the mats doing jiu-jitsu, watching UFC 238 (such a great card) and spent more time practicing C. Feeling good about the upcoming week.</p>
