<section class="weekly">
    <p class="intro"> It's hard to believe that it has been a month already of Lambda School. We've come a long way.
      I am excited and slightly nervous about tomorrow's sprint challenge. I've struggled a bit this week to complete
      all of the projects. It's mostly been silly mistakes that send me down a path that leads to a new mistake and
      before long I've lost myself and am not sure where the problem is. I felt good Monday and Tuesday but
      Functional Programming has been a bit of a challenge. After doing some review I've noticed that most of my
      errors have been simple spelling mistakes or forgetting to closely check how to call the CSS on a query
      selector. I'll be on the lookout for that during tomrrow's sprint.   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learn to program <a href="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LambdaSchool</a>‚ù§Ô∏è Awesome curriculum, instructors, pm&#39;s, students &amp; no tuition until after you&#39;ve graduated and are hiredü§Ø Sign up with my ambassador link üî•<a href="https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL">https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL</a>üî• if you are interested!

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">DOM I - Intro</span></h4>
        <p> I felt really good about this day and probably overconfident as we moved into Tuesday. I had done a fair
          amount of work over the weekend watching the previous cohort's lecture and starting the project. I didn't
          appreciate the subtle difference between query and element selectors which cost me heading into Wednesday
          but I learned a lot on this day. We learned that the DOM stands for the Document Object Model which is an
          object representation of the HTML of a website that is a tree structure that can be traversed and used to
          give functionality to websites. The things you can do once you learn this are amazing and I couldn't wait
          to try the stretch project (a timer that I want to convert into my own jiu-jitsu round timer). A great
          start to the week. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">DOM II - Events & Propagation </span></h4>
        <p>This was great, we learned how websites listen for events (such as a mouseclick) and respond to that event
          in some way. We place what are called event listeners on our DOM elements. There were tons to play with.
          The project entailed adding some to a project we had worked on previously, the Fun Bus Website. I had a
          good time changing things and learning how to make websites interactive. I did not get to the stretch task
          on this day and I started to get a bit lost using query selectors to work with some of the event listeners
          that I was trying to implement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Components I - Intro</span></h4>
        <p>We began to learn about components and functional programming as an overall theme. I found the material to
          be really cool because it allows you to do so much on a website with the skills we have learned so far.
          Components use HTML, CSS, and Javascript as a chunk of code that can be used to give a website
          functionality. This was the day we brought it all home and learned how to use objects as classes to target
          various parts of a website using any methods we wanted. I loved how our project solved a question I was
          grappling with on this very blog which was, how do I organize all these posts in a way that a user can
          quickly read what he wants and hide the rest? Components. I failed at completing the project on time due
          mainly to silly mistakes and typos but I'm starting to see it come together.

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Components II- Class Syntax and Data Attributes
          </span></h4>
        <p>Learning how to make classes interact and dance with class syntax and data attributes. So here we are now
          able to pass data from our HTML to our CSS/Javascript using data attributes. One application of this could
          be linking different components on a website that share behavior. I, again, failed to complete the project
          on time. Again, silly mistakes. I didn't catch a capitalization error which was giving me a headache and I
          added a period to a class selector that didn't need it. I'm hoping I don't make the same mistakes tomorrow.</p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint Challenge 4 - Applied Javascript</span></h4>
        <p> In this sprint we are completing challenges similar to what we've been working on all week. We'll see how
          this goes.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp"> Sprint was good this week. I finished the basics with about 20 minutes to spare. There were
        definitely some moments of uncertainty but I had a huge breakthrough in this challenge. I was able to
        successfully debug my program using the debugger tools we had been shown this week. They were so clutch in
        getting the logic to work as I wanted. It felt amazing to figure something out that I had struggled with all
        week. I spent the next few days tinkering with the stretch goal of getting the an image carousel to work and
        got that done today. The project itself was to create functionality to a website that behaved like the LA
        Times page. Naturally it was called the Lambda Times. What I really loved is that this week gave an an answer
        to a question I had which was how to display the contents of this blog in a more organized way. Use
        components! Going to restyle the site over the next week using all we've learned. This upcoming week is a
        4-day long Sprint challenge where we take all our training for the past month and put it all to use. We got a
        preview on Friday and it all looks very do-able. Looking forward to next week and beyond.</p>
