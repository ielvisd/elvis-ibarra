    <p class="intro">
        Another fun week at Lambda School. This week focused on automated testing which is a way to be confident that your code will do what it says it does. Although some of the assignments were a bit tedious this week I appreciated all the practice I got by the time the last lecture came and I saw my peers guide our instructor on a complete end to end test. It was awesome. I was able to finish the sprint where we used Test-Driven-Development (TDD) to create a simple Web API using Node.js and Express.</p>

              <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1: </span> <span class="day">Introduction to Automated Testing
                </span></h4>
                <p> On day one we were given a broad overview as to why testing is important and were shown how to use Jest to automate tests for you. We were then given a 2-day project to write lots of test for. I was able to finish the day 1 assignment but there sure were a lot of tests to write. Automated testing is pretty cool, I liked how I could check for something before I created it and that would guide how it was built. We talked about the benefits and downsides of coding using test-driven development. It was hard to see the connection to a full application since we didn't get to React testing until day 3 but it was an interesting new topic.   </p>
        <div class="text-content">
            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2: </span> <span class="day">Automated Testing II
              </span></h4>
            <p> On the second day of our intro to automated testing we talked some more about testing philosophy and explored how to setup our tests to work asynchronously. We got a lot more functions to test for part 2 of our project and I ended up running out of time because I wrote too many tests for the first couple of functions without realizing just how many we had to do.</p>

            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Testing React Applications</span></h4>
                    <p> This was a very cool lecture. There was a lot of practice creating the React app from scratch which was welcome since it's been a few lessons since we've been required to build with React. We used Enzyme and Jest to snapshot our components and test what they do. I didn't finish the project on time because I was still a bit confused with how to use the Jest documentation in conjunction with Enzyme but luckily I've gotten a lot of practice and I was able to debug by the end of the day.

            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Testing Web API's</span></h4>
            <p>We finished our front end curriculum with a ðŸ”¥ lecture where our instructor used members of my cohort to pair program a full end-to-end test for a Web API. It was awesome to see my classmates crush it and be able to take our instructor step by step through the process. We learned how to use an npm module called supertest that loads an instance of our server which lets us make requests and test our assertions about the responses. I struggled a bit to get it setup but once I fixed my issue (it was in the setup of my files) I was good to go. I used most of this day's knowledge in the next day's sprint. I didn't quite finish everything I needed to do for this project since I ran out of time with my error but I was confident that I could do the sprint since everything was working.

            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 14 - Testing</span></h4>
            <p> For our last regular sprint of the front-end portion of the curriculum we used Test-Driven-Development (TDD) to create a simple Web API using Node.js and Express. I decided to go for it and implement a stretch goal of using a database to do a full end to end test. I ran into an issue where my routes where in the same file as my `server.listen` which was causing an issue with my tester. It was a rookie mistake which cost me a few hours. Once I cleaned it up I had a nice looking database which will serve me well in next week's Sprint Challenge. Every Sprint Challenge so far has taught me something new in one way or another.

              <p class="weeklyp"> This was an enjoyable week after I got through the tediousness of learning tests for the first time on a bunch of functions. I understood why we were doing it, there's lots of different types of problems we'll see as engineers and we should be able to apply our skills to many different scenarios. I loved how it all came together when we built a React app with snapshot testing and also tested the web API we built. I'm stoked for project week and to play with all the skills I've learned during our 3 week break.  </p>
