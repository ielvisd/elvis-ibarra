  <section class="weekly">
    <p class="intro">This week we learned some more advanced React techniques and worked on a week long project to
      create the User Interface for an Instagram Clone. It was definitely the toughest week by far but at the same
      time I feel like my preparation and truly trusting the process helped me successfully finish this week's Sprint
      challenge which seemed daunting just a few days ago. I also pair programmed for the first time this week which
      was a fun learning experience and something that I need to go out of my way to do more of.   </p>
    <div class="top-content">
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">React Tooling</span></h4>
        <p>We had this day off for Indigenous People's Day but we were expected to complete Day 1 & Day 2 parts of
          the week-long project by end of day Tuesday so we were still expected to have Day 1 work done by Tuesday
          morning.
          We were free to do this anytime starting Friday afternoon. I spent the weekend working on Code Academy's
          React part 1 course because I still felt a bit shaky and I'm glad I did. It was a confidence boost #1
          because I was amazed at how much I
          already knew and but #2 I was able to appreciated some things that I missed or just saw in a different
          light going through these
          exercises. I got through the course over the weekend and while it definitely holds your hand a bit too much
          and is not as deep as the Lambda projects I appreciated going over the basics one more time. Learn from
          wherever you can. Anyway, on
          Monday I started and mostly finished the project for the day. The content was all about setting up a React
          project on your local machine. It seemed a bit redundant since many of the tutorials when we started React
          were on this topic but I can see why it was necessary to go over this since we had been in a code sandbox
          for the previous week (at least for instruction). We also went over how to use PropTypes to 'type check'
          data being passed to our components. Basically putting a check into our code for ourselves and future
          developers to know the type of data that a component expects. I didn't appreciate how useful this would be
          until later in the week.</p>

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">The React Lifecycle
          </span></h4>
        <p>Whooo... this was a topic that felt like we could've spent a week on to get good at or maybe that's just
          me. The React Lifecycle refers to every component in React having a lifecycle. It's not a complicated
          concept, a piece of UI is created, used, and terminated/deathed when it has served its function. There's a
          lot however going on under the hood and some new methods were introduced that React components can use to
          manipulate
          data and share it amongst other components. We were expected to use these newly taught skills to make our
          Instagram Clone come alive and be able to add comments to posts and increase the like count by clicking on
          the hearts. This seemed pretty straight forward before React but now we needed to set a state and pass it
          down? I understood during lecture but in practice I was struggling. Luckily I picked the perfect day to
          pair program. I had a good conversation the previous week with one of my peers in the cohort during our
          code review and we were both struggling then so I suggested we tag team this project in the afternoon after
          lecture. Luckily he agreed and we struggled through it together. We didn't successfully implement the add
          comment functionality but we got close! Luckily I have some awesome people in my smaller group that I meet
          with daily during stand-up and they were able to explain how they solved the problem which showed me where
          my mistake was. I felt shaky but ready for day 3 after reviewing the solution code for the day and looking
          at the following day's material.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">React Composition Patterns</span></h4>
        <p>This was another topic which felt like I could've spent way more time on (...and I plan to!). A Higher
          Ordered Component (HOC) is pattern seen in React that gives reusability to component logic. It is a
          function that receives a component as an argument and returns a component. The name is a bit misleading in
          that respect. Our Day 3 project with this concept was to implement an authorization page on our Instagram
          Clone using a Higher Order Component. Once again the lecture felt smooth and I felt ready to implement but
          it was definitely tricky and I didn't finish on time. I did get a chance to review the previous day's
          solution and started to get a better sense for how React works. I can't say how thankful I am to have great
          peers in my group who do a great job of explaining their work and my project manager as well who is
          encouraging and helfpul in answering our questions or finding somebody who will. I was starting to feel a
          little bit nervous about the upcoming Sprint Challenge on Friday after having failed to finish my project
          in time for two days in a row but I took solace in being able to read the solution and be able to follow
          along during lecture.

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">CSS in JS - Styled Components</span></h4>
        <p>Day 4 brought a well-received 'easy' topic with Styled Components. Having the ability to style your
          components from within your React file looked really cool when it was demonstrated and it was super simple
          to implement. It's really fascinating to see the different ways there are to do the same thing and having
          the ability to pick and choose based on the situation or your personal preference. This day's project was
          pretty easy - refactor the previous day's page to use styled components. I spent most of the day reviewing
          HOC material from the day before. I didn't feel 'ready' for the Sprint but I was confident that either way
          I had learned a lot this week and was reminded by a peer that two weeks ago I didn't even know what React
          was.</p>

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 7 - React Lambda Times</span></h4>
        <p>This project brought back a previous project we had worked on when we were learning about Functional
          Components - The Lambda Times. Our task was to refactor our prior project using React. Most of the code was
          built out for us but there was definitely a lot for us to do! I hacked away at it and was mostly done by
          the time 11am hit. If I haven't mentioned it before you are expected to work on your sprint from 8-11am
          PST. I was stuck getting my articles to update based on my selected tab. I was growing frustrated but I
          knew I was close. I told my project manager that I would wrap up shortly after lunch. After getting some
          food in me I got back to it and after plenty of console logging and React debugging I got it to work! I
          guess I
          knew some React after all.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp">This was definitely one of the most fulfilling weeks in my time at Lambda School. I
        struggled but I knew that the concepts would come with practice and time. Plus if you are struggling then it
        definitely means that you are learning. I was super happy to pull this week's project off and am off to prep
        for next week's material on... let's see... Single Page Applications using React Router and HTTP/AJAX... umm
        time to go read
        up!</p>
