  <section class="weekly">
    <p class="intro"> This week we started to learn JavaScript. It was great to see how JavaScript connects with HTML
      and CSS to produce content we see on web pages and applications across the internet. My favorite activity of
      the week was adding content to the start of a text-based RPG using the JavaScript skills I had been learning
      throughout the week.   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learn to program <a href="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LambdaSchool</a>‚ù§Ô∏è Awesome curriculum, instructors, pm&#39;s, students &amp; no tuition until after you&#39;ve graduated and are hiredü§Ø Sign up with my ambassador link üî•<a href="https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL">https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL</a>üî• if you are interested!

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript I - Fundamentals</span></h4>
        <p> We got into it right away on day 1. We covered some of the basics in the first hour of the lecture: variables and arrays and then moved onto objects and functions in the 2nd hour. Presently to be accepted to Lambda School you have to complete the pre-course work which included a lot of this JavaScript material or pass the Lambda Challenge which is an on-line JavaScript test essentially. Luckily I had already completed Khan Academy's Javascript section which was extremely helpful in getting me to pass the Lamba Challenge but was also a great foundation for this week's content, especially once we got to object methods and classes. We wrapped this day up talking about the differences between 'function scope' and 'block scope' and
          completed a project where we created objects and used array methods to retrieve specific information from a
          large data array.

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript II - Closure, Callbacks & Advanced Array
            Methods </span></h4>
        <p>On day 2 we covered the concept of closure, callback and introduced advanced array methods to simplify our
          work from the previous day. This was a bit confusing at first but once I started to practice and fix my
          mistakes it was easier than I thought. Closure simply refers to a function within a function, this function
          will have access to its own variables and methods and those of its parent function but the parent will not
          have access to the child's attributes or methods. A callback refers to a function that references another
          function which it needs in order to run. Advanced array methods such as .filter, .map & .reduce are ways to
          go through an array and pull meaningful data in various ways. The part of the project which was a bit tough
          for me today was creating a counter function that increments each time it is called. Once I saw my mistake
          in implementation the concept of closure became a lot clearer. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript III - 'this' Keyword</span></h4>
        <p>Here we learned how to use the 'this' keyword to interact with the objects we create in JavaScript. The
          four types of binding for 'this' are: Implicit, Explicit, New & Window. Implicit binds 'this' to whatever
          is to the left of the dot when 'this' is used. Explicit binding is when 'this' is bound to a function
          method (using call(), apply() or bind()). You can use a functions 'this' scope as the context when you call
          or apply (to array) it. Bind is used to store a 'this' for later use. New is used to bind 'this' to new
          objects created by Constructor Functions. Binds 'this' to the constructor function object. Finally, Window
          binds the 'this' keyword to a global or window-scope.

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript IV - Refactoring and the Class Keyword
          </span></h4>
        <p>Major 'aha' moment for me on this day. Seeing our objects we've been working with this week transform
          using the Class keyword made closure and inheritance seem way easier than they looked at the beginning of
          the week. The structure is nicer and made my coding go at a much faster rate. Our project involved
          refactoring (converting) our constructors into ES6 classes from the previous day's project and using our
          new skills to create a "school" in Javascript using different classes and methods (for Instructors,
          Students and Project Managers). I feel ready for today's Sprint Challenge now.</p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint Challenge 3 - Assessing Your JavaScript
            Fundamentals</span></h4>
        <p> In this sprint we are completing challenges similar to what we've been working on all week. Should be
          pretty straightforward. There hasn't been anything tricky or different from what we've been covering each
          week in these Sprint Challenges which makes them challenging yet allows you to demonstrate that you
          understand the knowledge from the week. Time to get started!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp"> Sprint 3 is finished. I completed all tasks with a few minutes to spare and completed the
        stretch goal 8 minutes past the hour. There were some tricky portions but it was more of myself overthinking
        what I had just learned rather than the problems themselves being tough. JavaScript fundamentals was tough
        but I learned a lot this week as I have every week of this Lambda experience. </p>
