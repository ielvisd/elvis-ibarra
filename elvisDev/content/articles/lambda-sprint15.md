 <section class="weekly">
  <p class="intro">
  15 weeks down, 1/2 way thru Lambda School's full stack web development curriculum. What a ride. Today I presented the project that I have been working on all week to my entire cohort during demo hour. I was nervous but I knew that my project worked and that even though I didn't have the fanciest of features, it was functional and I had built it using all the skills I had gained over the past 15 weeks. I deployed my front end (built with React/Redux) to Github Pages and the Back End to Heroku. I am so happy that it went well and that I was able to pull of this project and hit some stretch goals. I'm so glad that I decided to apply and attend Lambda School. As my instructor Luis said "What if I told you that Lambda Notes was only the beginning?" </p>

            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1: </span> <span class="day">Setting up the Server & Updating the Front End
              </span></h4>
              <p> Got right to work and setup my Trello board with MVP and some stretch goals. I felt confident that I would be able to finish the project but was also slightly nervous because I had been confident in the past only to finish right in the nick of time. I was able to wire up my server and started to adjust some of my routes to point to the new backend instead of Lambda's pre-built server. It was great to make significant progress on day one.   </p>
      <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2: </span> <span class="day">Deploying the Backend & Updating Routes on the Front End
            </span></h4>
          <p> I essentially hit MVP on this day. I had my front end and back end working nicely by the end of the day but I knew there was a problem. I had not changed my production to be postgres which would give my database real persistence. Our instructor was going over this in the following lecture so I made sure my project was good to go otherwise. Things were ready. </p>

      <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Postgres Update & JWT Authentication</span></h4>
                  <p> Our instructor showed us how to deploy our backend to Heroku and make modifications necessary to change the database to postgres in production. This brought a few tiny changes I needed to make to keep it all working the same (Sqlite3 to Postgres) but nothing too complicated. After I had this setup I spent most of my time getting an authentication system to work. I was so happy to see a JWT token after a user had logged in after getting it all setup. The app had come a long way in 3 days.

      <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Small Tweaks and Presenting to the Cohort</span></h4>
          <p>Now that my authentication was working I started to make some modifications to the front-end with the new routes and logic. I commented this out just before the demo because I ran out of time in incorporating this logged in status to a user's personal notes but is definitely something I"ll be revisiting over the break. The demo was the most nerve-wracking part but I quickly got over it once I committed to doing it and prepped my project with a practice run-through. Really though, I was so happy it was all working with about 2 minutes to spare. It went well and it was bitter-sweet to be done with this part of the course. Some of us will be moving onto labs, some to CS and some will be full-time PM's. I'm not sure what I'll be doing yet (Labs or CS) but I'll keep you posted.

            <p class="weeklyp"> It's Friday morning as I write this piece and I just found out that I was selected to be part of a pilot group that is doing Labs before the CS portion of the curriculum ðŸ˜ƒ. This morning I saw the current Labs group present and was blown away by all the awesome projects. I'm looking forward to the next step in this awesome journey. Over the break I plan on working some more on the playlist app that we began working on over Thanksgiving Break, re-learning some Python and learning some Vue.js.
