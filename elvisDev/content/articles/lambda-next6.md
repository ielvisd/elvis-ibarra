  <p class="intro">
      This past week was busy both in and out of Lambda School. I spent a lot of time this week studying Ruby, Vue and getting ready for the Zeit hackathon. After this weekend it's intro to C for my CS17 group and build week for my webPT4 group which is nice because I get extra time to focus on guiding the CS students through the introduction to C which can be tricky. It's a challenge but I'm excited to work through it all.  </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Week: </span> <span class="day">TA for CS17 (Build Week), webPT4 (Redux - Async/Middleware) & Career Work
          </span></h4>
          <p> This was a fun week where I had some time to put into my own projects/studying since most of my students were busy being team leads for build week. I started to explore Ruby and am having fun learning a new language. This upcoming week my CS students are going into C which is a very interesting language that I'm excited to revisit. I also had a technical interview this week which was really fun and I'm looking forward to seeing what's next!  </p>

  <p class="weeklyp"> This weekend I'm pairing up with one of my teammates from Labs to work on a Discord Bot for the Zeit hackathon. I'm super excited about this opportunity and it will be great practice for an upcoming on-site interview. Lambda School has opened up so many doors for me and given me the skills to tackle any task. Looking forward to seeing what we build! First Hackathon! </p>
