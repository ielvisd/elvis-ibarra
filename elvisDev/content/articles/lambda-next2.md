  <p class="intro">
      2 weeks as a TA has had a huge impact on my programming confidence. Revisiting key concepts in computer science has been really illuminating and I look forward to continuing to learn as much as possible in my new role as a Lambda TA. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Week: </span> <span class="day">TA for CS17, Build Week Team Lead for webPT4 & Jiujitsio (Lambda/Pioneer April Tournament update)
          </span></h4>
          <p> I've started to implement a lot of the feedback that I've received over the past couple of days as TA. I am getting more comfortable coding without a solution in front of me and being ok showing the process of how I debug/program and then providing the solution at the end if we fail to get through the demo. I think this helps show problem solving strategies and also helps keep the class engages as I am asking them to code along with me. I admit that I was a bit nervous at first, I've taught before but never in this format, and it's taken me a few days to find my groove but I feel  like I'm starting to find my own style and am getting comfortable with this format. It took me a few days to get back into the swing of Python but once we got going I've surprised myself with how quickly I can whip up a demo or solve problems that once took me hours to complete. Feels like I'm starting to see it all come together now. I'm really thankful for the opportunity to TA and interact with the Lambda instructors & students in this role. I also had a couple of interviews this week where I could see that my time talking through CS topics as a TA has helped me better communicate what I've learned and accomplished during my time at Lambda.</p>

  <p class="weeklyp"> My build week team is doing great with GigaPets and I am struggling to implement features on JiuJitsio =/ Mostly due to time constraints. I'm happy knowing that I have an app I can work on for a long time even if I"m the only user =) The plan is to hack on it tomorrow and try to make it presentable for the final day of the April Lambda/Pioneer tournament which is on Monday. This is also demo day for webPT4 build week, gonna be a fun week!  </p>
