  <p class="intro">
      Wasn't sure if I was going to continue to keep writing after finishing the Lambda curriculum but I think this helps me stay focused and is a good way to keep myself accountable. This week I began my role as TA for CS17 leading guided projects on this weeks topic - Intro to Python. As a TA I hope that I can help students understand the material and/or guide them to the proper resource depending on the question/topic. I'm thankful to be given this opportunity and so far I am learning a lot in the process. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Week: </span> <span class="day">TA for CS17, Build Week Team Lead for webPT4 & Jiujitsio (Lambda/Pioneer April Tournament update)
          </span></h4>
          <p> Most of my time was dedicated to studying Python and the Guided Projects so that I could deliver them to the best of my ability. I'm trying to take in all the feedback and adapt as quickly as possible to make it a worthwhile experience for the students. I will say that I enjoy Python much more this go around. Also I'm a team lead for the Gigapets build week project for webPT4, I have an awesome team that is crushing it. I didn't make as much progress as I would have liked on jiujitsio but I did debug my database and am now making progress on some routes. All in all a very productive week.   </p>

  <p class="weeklyp"> Next week I'm leading guided projects on the topic of Algorithms and trying to implement some features on jiujitsio while helping my build week team to the finish line. Wish me luck!    </p>
