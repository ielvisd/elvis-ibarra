<section class="weekly">
    <p class="intro">This week we learned how to use media queries to build websites that look good on devices of all
      sizes. We also learned how to use a preprocessor (LESS) to take our CSS skills to another level. Preprocessors
      are used to increase productivity and reduce errors in that it allows us to re-use codes by using variables and
      nesting. My favorite project this week was the personal resume page because I was able to throw it right on
      this website and it was fun to create.   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learn to program <a href="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LambdaSchool</a>‚ù§Ô∏è Awesome curriculum, instructors, pm&#39;s, students &amp; no tuition until after you&#39;ve graduated and are hiredü§Ø Sign up with my ambassador link üî•<a href="https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL">https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL</a>üî• if you are interested!

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">Responsive Design I - Layouts and Media Queries</span></h4>
        <p>Although this was technically a holiday we were still assigned a lecture the previous Friday and had up
          until the end of day 2 to finish the project. We learned what it means for a site to be fixed, fluid,
          adaptive or responsive and how to use media queries to make sites that we design behave and look as
          intended. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">Responsive Design II - Fully Responsive </span></h4>
        <p>This was the official start of the week and we started at the beginning, going over many of the concepts
          from the intro video, but by the end we had learned how to make sites fully repsonsive using percent based
          values. It was very interesting to hear not only the technical side of coding but also the real world
          application of when to use a desktop first approach vs. a mobile first design. Great start to the week. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Preprocessors I - LESS</span></h4>
        <p>We were introduced to the LESS syntax and learned how this is turned into CSS by a Javascript compiler.
          Once I saw LESS in action there was a real lightbulb moment and a lot of web development was demystified
          all at once. It became clear how you could organize all kinds of data and pages using this powerful tool.
          This was the day we created our digital resumes for daily project. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Preprocessors II - LESS Variables, Mixins,
            Namespaces & Project Organization </span></h4>
        <p>We dived deeper into LESS and learned how large projects can be organized using a master LESS file.</p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint Challenge 2 - Responsive Web Design and
            Preprocessing</span></h4>
        <p> In this sprint we updated a website using the responsive web design skills that we learned throughout the
          week. Portions of the website were provided and we were expected to match a desktop and mobile design using
          the LESS preprocessor and then submit a pull request using Github.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp"> Feeling really good about these first two weeks. I feel like I have learned an incredible
        amount in a really short amount of time and am having a lot of fun doing it. Time to study up on some
        Javascript, looking at the material before the lecture has been really helpful in not getting lost during
        lecture.</p>
