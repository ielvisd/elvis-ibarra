<section class="weekly">
  <p class="intro">
      This was a tough week but I enjoyed learning and seeing how Graphs were implemented not just as a basic data structure but as a powerful tool to display and search through data and solve real-world problems. I also got to meet the group of students that I'll be leading through Build Week on Friday and we started to brainstorm some ideas of what to do with our app. I chose a data science/web hybrid project with a focus on the FIFA 19 database. Super excited to get started on that but first a recap of the week. </p>
      <div class="top-content">
        <div class="text-content">
            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1 & 2: </span> <span class="day">Graphs, Traversals & Randomness
              </span></h4>
              <p>We covered a lot over these first 2 days, the reason being that we actually had a 2 1/2 day sprint challenge we started on Wednesday. This was the first time a Sprint was structured this way for me but I think that working on the fly and making adjustments are part of how Lambda operates and I've learned to be flexible. I learned that a graph is basically like a tree structure except instead of nodes having children up and down they can connect with any other node in the structure.</p>
              <p>After we learned the basic structure of a graph we began to explore more details such as weighted graphs and directed vs un-directed graphs, and cyclical graphs. We also incorporated the algorithms we had previously learned to traverse and search our graphs. We were assigned a 2-day project with some challenging stretch goals. It was nice that the assignment was spaced out and I was able to finish MVP on each of the 2 days.  </p>
              <p>One thing that I'm doing differently during CS that I didn't do as much of during the web-dev portion is pair-programming. It's helped me so much to be able to ask questions and get instant feedback from my peers. We have a good group that hangs out after lecture and works on the assignments together. It's been nice.  </p>

                <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3, 4 & 5: </span> <span class="day">Graphs Sprint Challenge
                  </span></h4>
                  <p>This sprint challenge was new just for our cohort and it was really simple (as far as total length of the solution code is concerned) but incredibly complex at the same time. We had to write code that would allow our player to traverse a 500 room graph. Since we had lecture on 2 days that we had this Sprint, the instructor went over the approach we should take and helped the class pseudo-code one possible approach. Some students finished MVP on day 1 but I needed the entire 2 1/2 days. I had a flaw in my mental model of the problem that I was able to clear up after day 2 of lecture. By that night I was close to a solution and was able to implement it that Friday morning. I'm excited to work more with graphs and go back and explore some of the stretch goals that I didn't get to this week. </p>

            <p class="weeklyp">Hard to believe but the first month of the CS curriculum has come and gone. On the 5th week we get to participate in build-weeks as team leads. I chose a data science-web hybrid project which means we get 2 data science students in addition to front-end, back-end, and user interface roles. The project I chose involves the FIFA 19 dataset. I'm really excited to work in this role and be part of another amazing project with fellow Lambda students. Should be another fun week! âš½</p>
