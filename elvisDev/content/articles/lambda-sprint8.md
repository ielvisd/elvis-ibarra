 <section class="weekly">
    <p class="intro"> This week we focused on learning two packages with React: Axios and React Router. Now that I've
      had 3 weeks working with React I'm starting to get comfortable building with it. Being able to start a local
      server and interact with the data was fascinating to use, and simple too now that I have more reps under my belt.
      I'm finally starting to appreciate how useful
      React can truly be.  </p>
    <div class="top-content">
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">React Router I</span></h4>
        <p> We started the week learning the difference between client-side routing and server-side routing. The pros
          and cons of having all your data brought in at the beginning vs pinging a server and having your page
          reload with each request. We then started to learn and implement the Client Side Routing Library (React
          Router). This gave us the ability to create dynamic routes using URL parameters to display our components
          with whatever user interaction we needed. Being able to match items to URL paths and seeing how easy it was
          gave e a great sigh of relief after a tough two weeks. We had two projects to complete over the next two
          days relating to this topic. I finished the first pretty quickly that day and left about half the second
          project for the next day. A smooth start to the week. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">React Router II - Sub-routes and Link/NavLink
          </span></h4>
        <p>This day we dove deeper into React Router and although it was a bit more intense (content-wise) I was still
          able to follow along. Looking back I didn't appreciate how the render prop or the history object was used
          until it came time for the sprint. With React Router you can pass data to components via the render prop, I
          didn't really understand what this meant until Friday. I was also confused with the history object that React
          Router has but it all cleared up on Friday. I truly appreciate React Router and its intricacies until I had
          used it for a few days in a row. I finished my project but didn't hit stretch goals. I felt at the time like
          I understood the basics but still needed practice to be able to implement any of the stretch goals we were
          given. Link and NavLink are used in React Router to link as the names imply but NavLink can add an
          active-class to a selection which is awesome for styling purposes. </p></div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">HTTP/AJAX I</span></h4>
        <p>On day 3 of this week we learned what AJAX meant (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and learned how to
          perform requests to an external server in order to retrieve, create, modify, or remove information. We were
          also introduced to Axios which is a library for performing promise based HTTP requests. These promises are
          what allow you to make multiple asynchronous requests and continue with your apps operation until those
          requests are fulfilled or rejected. It was pretty straightforward but the project we were using to explain
          the concept was pretty complex and interesting. We learned our request via a web store applications whose
          items we could add, edit, or remove. Cool to see the concepts we were learning in an actual application.
          Although some if it wasn't clear in real time seeing the videos again and being able to pause and follow
          along was key for me. I realize through this journey that I'm not great during live lectures. I try my best
          to keep up but if I mess up a keystroke or for whatever reason don't follow along for a few minutes I'll be
          lost and just watching along instead of coding for myself. I much prefer watching a prerecorded lecture where
          I could go at my own pace. That's just a personal preference. I appreciate the live lectures 100% but I know
          that moving forward I will appreciate them way more knowing that I don't always have to keep up and can and
          should be instead going back and watching at my own pace at a future time. Or, even better, a cool thing
          about Lambda School is that the previous cohort's videos are available for us to watch. So instead of going
          through the training kit and trying to read and do the exercises this week, instead I watched all the videos
          from prior cohort's lectures and followed through those. When it came time for our live lecture I got lost
          (coding along) as expected but I had already seen and understood the material so I wasn't stressing. I was
          still able to do the projects because I had put in the time to watch and code along to the exercises the
          night before, same instructor and everything! I love the ability to play a video at 2x or pause for 20+
          minutes if needed. Especially with all the new content we are consistently learning.

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">HTTP / AJAX II - Axios</span></h4>
        <p>We finished our online store demo using Axios to add, modify and delete items. I completed my project for
          the day but I wasn't able to hit stretch or delete/modify my entry. It wasn't required for our sprint the
          following day but it is something that I'm working on learning. I also am at 90% on Code Academy's second
          React course which helped clear a few things up again this week, have to mention it as a fun learning tool
          that I'm using along with Lambda School. </p>

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 8 - React (SPA) Smurfs</span></h4>
        <p>This project was fun. We built out a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application that consumes an API to
          update Smurfs being shown on screen. I hit MVP way before time was up and I was surprised at how well I had
          done compared to the two previous weeks. I even hit a stretch goal of implementing a delete feature. POST is
          still tricky for me to implement on a solo project but it is something I"ll have down by project week with
          lots more practice to come. </p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp">2 months later and I have no doubts that I made the right decision with Lambda School. I'm
        learning more than ever before and couldn't of asked for a better experience. Next week we are learning Redux
        which is a state management system and then we have our week long project week for this front end section of
        the curriculum. This is going by so fast!</p>
