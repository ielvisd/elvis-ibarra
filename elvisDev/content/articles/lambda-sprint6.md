<section class="weekly">
    <p class="intro">This week was all about React. React is a UI library that was developed by Facebook that allows
      you to create small, reusable pieces of UI that can be put together to make larger applications. There wasn't
      anything tough conceptually but it was a lot at once this week and I struggled with some of the syntax and how
      to apply state across my components. A tough week but I got through it and after putting in sometime this
      weekend to review I feel better heading into week 7. </p>
    <div class="top-content">
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">Functional Components I</span></h4>
        <p>We started the week with the basics, what is React and what potential problems does it address? I touched
          on this in the intro but the answer is data. React is a way to interact will all the potential ways a user
          can use the application and interact or provide data and have that application re-render in an efficient
          way. React allows us to do this using Components. I finished the day 1
          project on time which was to use JSX to create a social card which was a copy of a Twitter Tweet. Fun to
          see on a day 1 project. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">Functional Components II
            Shape </span></h4>
        <p>Day 2's focus was on the use of props in React and how tio implement the map function to loop through an
          array and display multiple elements at once or just loop through data that would be given or needed to be
          used in an application. We created a calculator application without the functionality (that was stretch) as
          our project and I finished MVP on time. Tuesday was the day that I attended my first Lambda School
          after-hours from 6-8pm PST. After-hours are on Tuesday and Thursdays and they are an extra Q&A session with
          an instructor who goes over questions or just gives more examples. I was feeling a little bit overwhelmed
          with the new info and decided to attend and I'm glad I did. I cleared up a lot of misconceptions I had and
          reinforced some of the material from the morning lecture.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Class Components I</span></h4>
        <p>We talked about Class Components which are unique to React and are how we manage our data and user
          interaction. Introducing state and passing that down to the components. I should mention that we got a new
          instructor this week (every 5 weeks at Lambda School for each new unit) and the lectures have been good. I
          follow along content-wise but when it came to implementing this day's project I got a bit tripped up. The
          task was to create functional to-do list. This involved having to take user input and interaction. I
          realized that a majority of my problems were simple spelling errors "do" vs. "Do" or a misuse of syntax. I
          was ok knowing that I could understand my peers work during standup.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Class Components II</span></h4>
        <p>Our project for the day was to finish our calculator project from the previous day. The lecture got into
          nested components and further instructions on how to use setState to control how your components are
          rendered on screen. I stayed for a 2nd after hours because I was still struggling with getting my events to
          work and my app to do what I wanted it to do. After reviewing the solution code I realized that I needed to
          brush up on my basic Javascript if I wanted to be successful with React.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 6 - React Wars</span></h4>
        <p>This project was easier than our calculator App but something about it was still giving me issues. We had
          to take data and render it to our screen in React. The data was from a Star Wars API which was awesome to
          use a real API in a project that I was creating. Seemed easy enough, I had done this multiple times
          throughout the course of the week. One thing slowed me down. I didn't pass down my props in my render
          function to my components! After carefully reviewing some similar projects I was able to finish on time and
          submit a product. I didn't hit stretch but I knew I had to spend some time over this 3 day weekend to brush
          up and really figure out where I went wrong. This blog goes a long way in clearing out those thoughts and
          figuring it out. </p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp">I spent some time this weekend on Code Academy in their React section. There were definitely
        some gaps in my understanding on the fundamentals and I feel way better about this upcoming week. I know we
        have another week-long project and I am ready to jump in knowing what to do and ready to execute. I'm going
        to look into peer programming for a bit this week so that I don't get stuck doing this by myself. I feel like
        I can solve my problems faster by just talking things through with somebody else. Next week we are building
        an Instagram clone in React learning new material such as prop checking and component styling.</p>
