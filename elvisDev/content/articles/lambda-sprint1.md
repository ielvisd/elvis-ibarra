        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">User Interface III - Flexbox</span></h4>
        <p>Learned how to use the flexbox module with the box model to refactor the previous day's assignment and
          style a new page. It all started to make sense on this day! I realized that I had not made use of an
          overall "container" in the prior day's assignment. Reviewing the solution and the flexbox lecture cleared
          it all up.</p>
