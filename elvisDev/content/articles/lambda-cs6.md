 <section class="weekly">
  <p class="intro">
      Spent most of the week working on a Coding Assessment as part of a company's interview process so I didn't get a chance to work on as much of this week's C material as I would have liked. Going to be going over this material next week as a Flex student which is there for situations like this where you might need to spend extra time coding for a work opportunity and you can pickup with the material where you left off. I attended every lecture so I feel prepared and I'm happy with the way the project turned out so it was a win-win =)   </p>

              <p>I received a Coding Assessment Monday morning to build a UI for an API that delivered an array of reviews with the author's name, publish date, rating & the content of the review. This was the first coding assessment I've received since I started applying and I was really excited to get started. I spent some time sketching out what I wanted to UI to look and act like (design & functionality) was up to me. Once I had a plan in place I started to build out a skeleton of my project and install all of the dependencies I would need. I was feeling good so far.  </p>
              <p>I took the opportunity to get some more practice using Hooks which was both awesome but very challenging when it came to implementing tests (write-up coming soon!). I spent a lot of time trying to not get my test suite to crash when trying to use state with my useContext hook. I finally managed to superficially run some tests but was ultimately disappointed that I couldn't get the tests that I wanted to try to run. Even though I was happy with the end result - an app which lazy loaded the reviews and then sorted by date, rating & had search functionality - I was still thinking about how I could have done testing or what the solution to my problem was.  </p>
              <p>The next day (after submitting the project) React 16.8.5 was released, part of the release was a fix for what was crashing my test suite all week (Enzyme wasn't able to preserve the state of Hooks between shallow render calls). I'm excited to do a write-up of the process and I'll post a link to that here when I"m finished.   </p>

            <p class="weeklyp">Even though I wasn't able to successfully complete the assignments this week I'm looking forward to hitting C hard next week now that I'm done with this project. I had a great time building something from scratch and flexing those Hook muscles. ðŸ’ª Going to spend some time doing a write-up of what I've learned this week and get back to finish testing my newly created app. </p>
