  <p class="intro">
      This was a tough week where we began to learn about different types of sorting algorithms and general problem solving techniques. We also started to do twice-a-week whiteboarding sessions, I got around to applying to some more jobs and began prepping for an upcoming interview. </p>

            <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1 & 2: </span> <span class="day">Sorting Algorithms
              </span></h4>
              <p>We had a 2-day assignment to start the week and the focus on was on modeling and implementing various sorting algorithms. It's nice that the assignments are spaced out over more than 1 day. It gives me a good chance at diving deep into the problems and understanding what's going on without moving too fast. The algorithms themselves weren't hard to understand or visualize but implementing them in Python was another story. It took me a bit to get MVP complete but after some trial/error and a bit of research I managed to finish MVP for this assignment. I felt like I was starting to understand Python a bit better after every coding session.  </p>

              <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3 & 4: </span> <span class="day">Problem Solving - Iteration, Recursion, Dynamic Programming
                </span></h4>
                <p>These were a fun 2 days. We had another 2 day assignment, this time more general in nature and we had to solve the problems in the assignment using the techniques we learned in class and then analyze their run-time complexity and begin to think about how we can make our programs more efficient. They weren't easy and I finished MVP shortly before our second standup but they were very interesting and I am starting to get more and more confident about being able to tackle any problem put in front of me.</p>

                <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5: </span> <span class="day">Algorithms Sprint Challenge
                  </span></h4>
                  <p>This Sprint Challenge was super interesting and not what I was expecting at all. We were given code for a robot that only had a few functions and 1-bit of memory (the light on it's head). This robot was supposed to sort a list that was given to it. Seemed simple enough and I thought I could figure it out pretty quickly. I was wrong! </p>
                  <p>There were lots of rules attached to what methods we could use and were restricted from declaring variables or accessing `self` values directly. I thought I had solved it initially but I had violated one of the rules and had to go back for a re-attempt. My second solution hanged for large lists. After talking to my PM I was given some more time to work on the project (until Sunday night).</p>
                  <p>This problem was all I could think about! After sleeping on it, I busted out the deck of playing cards again and began to think like the robot again. I came up with a plan, re-did the project and got the list sorted! After re-watching the lecture vids I figured out how to make even this iteration of my solution better using bubble sort but since I had sorted the given list and passed most of the test conditions my project was at MVP and I could move on to prepping for the upcoming week ðŸ˜….</p>

            <p class="weeklyp">Another fun, challenging week at LambdaSchool. While this CS portion is definitely tricky, I'm enjoying learning these topics and am starting to see how everything connects. It's really amazing to be able to go back to previous topics/lectures/podcasts of things that I am into, such as crypto, and be able to understand what is going on at a much deeper level. Similarly when researching algorithms, or problems I encounter while coding, I can navigate technical documentation or forums related to CS and know what most pages are talking about or at least begin to know where to start researching or what questions to ask. it's such a great feeling.</p>
            <p class="weeklyp">This upcoming week we're learning about data structures, I have my 1st interview since starting LambdaSchool, and am planning on sending out a couple more applications ðŸ’ª.</p>
