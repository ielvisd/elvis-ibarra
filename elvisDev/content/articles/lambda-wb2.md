    <p class="intro">
    Just a short update this week as we are on break for 3 weeks for the holidays.</p>
        <div class="top-content">

              <p class="weeklyp"> This week I slowed down the work on my notes project to focus on Python & start putting some job applications out into the world. I was curious where I was "skill-wise" and began to look at some listings. I was pleasantly suprised to see that I met the requirements for many positions almost perfectly. Most of the time the only thing that wasn't a match was the experience. There were some really interesting companies I saw that needed people with the skills that I just picked up over these last few months. It's a great feeling knowing that the hard work is paying off. I figure at worst I'll get some interview practice out if it. There's an exciting week up ahead with the LambdaSchool winter Hackathon happening and hopefully I can finish implementing collaboration on my notes project now that I'm almost done applying to the companies that caught my eye.
