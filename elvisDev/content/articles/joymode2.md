    Hi everyone I wanted to pick up where I left last time and recap months 4-6 at Joymode and give an update on my plans for 2020. The past couple of months have had a lot of changes but that’s to be expected from a startup and I enjoy the fast pace. I’ll try and cover the major changes and what I’ve learned.
  </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Months 4-6 </span> <span class="day">Working from Culver City, Joymode in Temecula, & More
          </span></h4>

          <p>A couple of months ago we began working out of the Culver City warehouse, this came with the flexibility of working 2-3 days a week remotely which I enjoyed and was used to from my time at Lambda School. During this time I found my tickets increasing in complexity and I was touching more and more of the codebase. We were launching new features/pages regularly and I started to get more practice in with Ruby on Rails and the backend database. One of my favorite things we put on the schedule was a bi-weekly pair programming session with my manager where we would code, review or explore new tech. It’s great to code with others and be able to build something together.
          </p>
          <p>Some highlights from this time include the launch of a physical Joymode location inside of the Temecula Walmart, new JoyPass membership, and gift cards. Each came with changes to the front end and their own unique learning experiences.  I definitely became really comfortable launching features quickly and iterating frequently.

  <h4><span class="daytags">2020 Plans</span> <span class="day">Reflecting & Moving Forward
    </span></h4>
    <p>Joymode has definitely been the best job I’ve ever had and I’m super thankful to have been able to work with this team for the past 6 months. I am, however, currently in a transition period looking for my next role. I've recently started to work on a jiu-jitsu app (jiujits.io) using the Quasar framework and am planning on wrapping up most of the MVP functionality I envisioned at the outset as I search for my next role. I’m planning on launching a dev journal for this app (jiujits.io/devJournal) as it’s likely going to be a long term project where I can learn and develop in public. As for my next professional role ideally I’m looking to join another mission-driven startup with an LA presence and/or a remote friendly culture where I can continue to learn and contribute.
    </p>
    <p>Lastly, I have to give Lambda School another shoutout. When I needed to learn a new technology (Ruby on Rails) to contribute to the backend codebase at Joymode  was easily able to complete a few projects in the supplemental coursework and feel confident contributing to production code. It’s amazing to have a place where you can continue to go too learn, chat with other developers, stay atop current technology/trends and just have a system of people who support and care for each other. There’s even a fitness Slack channel where we keep each other accountable on a daily basis.

                    <p class="weeklyp">I know I made the right decision in joining both Lambda School as well as Joymode. I have learned
                      so much from both and am confident I will have another announcement soon thanks to their training. Until then best
                      wishes and happy new year! </p>
