      <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> - Sprint 2 - <span class="weeklytitle">Responsive Design and Preprocessors</span></h2>
      <p class = "intro">This week we learned how to use media queries to build websites that look good on devices of all sizes. We also learned how to use a preprocessor (LESS) to take our CSS skills to another level. Preprocessors are used to increase productivity and reduce errors in that it allows us to re-use codes by using variables and nesting. My favorite project this week was the personal resume page because I was able to throw it right on this website and it was fun to create. <a class = "lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

          <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">Responsive Design I - Layouts and Media Queries</span></h4>
          <p>Although this was technically a holiday we were still assigned a lecture the previous Friday and had up until the end of day 2 to finish the project. We learned what it means for a site to be fixed, fluid, adaptive or responsive and how to use media queries to make sites that we design behave and look as intended.  </p>

          <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 2:</span>  <span class="day">Responsive Design II - Fully Responsive </span></h4>
          <p>This was the official start of the week and we started at the beginning, going over many of the concepts from the intro video, but by the end we had learned how to make sites fully repsonsive using percent based values. It was very interesting to hear not only the technical side of coding but also the real world application of when to use a desktop first approach vs. a mobile first design. Great start to the week. </p>

          <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 3:</span>  <span class="day">Preprocessors I - LESS</span></h4>
          <p>We were introduced to the LESS syntax and learned how this is turned into CSS by a Javascript compiler. Once I saw LESS in action there was a real lightbulb moment and a lot of web development was demystified all at once. It became clear how you could organize all kinds of data and pages using this powerful tool. This was the day we created our digital resumes for daily project. </p>

          <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Preprocessors II - LESS Variables, Mixins, Namespaces & Project Organization </span></h4>
          <p>We dived deeper into LESS and learned how large projects can be organized using a master LESS file.</p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint Challenge 2 - Responsive Web Design and Preprocessing</span></h4>
          <p> In this sprint we updated a website using the responsive web design skills that we learned throughout the week. Portions of the website were provided and we were expected to match a desktop and mobile design using the LESS preprocessor and then submit a pull request using Github.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="weeklyp"> Feeling really good about these first two weeks. I feel like I have learned an incredible amount in a really short amount of time and am having a lot of fun doing it. Time to study up on some Javascript, looking at the material before the lecture has been really helpful in not getting lost during lecture.</p>

          <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 3:</span>   <span class="day">User Interface III - Flexbox</span></h4>
          <p>Learned how to use the flexbox module with the box model to refactor the previous day's assignment and
            style a new page. It all started to make sense on this day! I realized that I had not made use of an
            overall "container" in the prior day's assignment. Reviewing the solution and the flexbox lecture cleared
            it all up.</p>
