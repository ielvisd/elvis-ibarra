          <h4>Day 3: <span class ="day">User Interface III - Flexbox</span></h4>
          <p>Learned how to use the flexbox module with the box model to refactor the previous day's assignment and style a new page. It all started to make sense on this day! I realized that I had not made use of an overall "container" in the prior day's assignment. Reviewing the solution and the flexbox lecture cleared it all up.</p>
