        <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> - Sprint 3 - <span class="weeklytitle">JavaScript Fundamentals</span></h2>
        <p class = "intro"> This week we started to learn JavaScript. It was great to see how JavaScript connects with HTML and CSS to produce content we see on web pages and applications across the internet. My favorite activity of the week was adding content to the start of a text-based RPG using the JavaScript skills I had been learning throughout the week. <a class = "lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

            <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript I - Fundamentals</span></h4>
            <p> We got into it right away on day 1. We covered some of the basics in the first hour of the lecture: variables and arrays and then moved onto objects and functions in the 2nd hour. 

            Presently to be accepted to Lambda School you have to complete the pre-course work which included a lot of this JavaScript material or pass the Lambda Challenge which is an on-line JavaScript test essentially. Luckily I had already completed Khan Academy's Javascript section which was extremely helpful in getting me to pass the Lamba Challenge but was also a great foundation for this week's content, especially once we got to object methods and classes. 
            
            We wrapped this day up talking about the differences between 'function scope' and 'block scope' and completed a project where we created objects and used array methods to retrieve specific information from a large data array.  </p>

            <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 2:</span>  <span class="day">JavaScript II - Closure, Callbacks & Advanced Array Methods </span></h4>
            <p>On day 2 we covered the concept of closure, callback and introduced advanced array methods to simplify our work from the previous day. This was a bit confusing at first but once I started to practice and fix my mistakes it was easier than I thought. Closure simply refers to a function within a function, this function will have access to its own variables and methods and those of its parent function but the parent will not have access to the child's attributes or methods. A callback refers to a function that references another function which it needs in order to run. Advanced array methods such as .filter, .map & .reduce are ways to go through an array and pull meaningful data in various ways. The part of the project which was a bit tough for me today was creating a counter function that increments each time it is called. Once I saw my mistake in implementation the concept of closure became a lot clearer. </p>

            <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 3:</span>  <span class="day">JavaScript III - 'this' Keyword</span></h4>
            <p>Here we learned how to use the 'this' keyword to interact with the objects we create in JavaScript. The four types of binding for 'this' are: Implicit, Explicit, New & Window. Implicit binds 'this' to whatever is to the left of the dot when 'this' is used. Explicit binding is when 'this' is bound to a function method (using call(), apply() or bind()). You can use a functions 'this' scope as the context when you call or apply (to array) it. Bind is used to store a 'this' for later use. New is used to bind 'this' to new objects created by Constructor Functions. Binds 'this' to the constructor function object. Finally, Window binds the 'this' keyword to a global or window-scope.

            <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript IV - Refactoring and the Class Keyword </span></h4>
            <p>Major 'aha' moment for me on this day. Seeing our objects we've been working with this week transform using the Class keyword made closure and inheritance seem way easier than they looked at the beginning of the week. The structure is nicer and made my coding go at a much faster rate. Our project involved refactoring (converting) our constructors into ES6 classes from the previous day's project and using our new skills to create a "school" in Javascript using different classes and methods (for Instructors, Students and Project Managers). I feel ready for today's Sprint Challenge now.</p>

            <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint Challenge 3 - Assessing Your JavaScript Fundamentals</span></h4>
            <p> In this sprint we are completing challenges similar to what we've been working on all week. Should be pretty straightforward. There hasn't been anything tricky or different from what we've been covering each week in these Sprint Challenges which makes them challenging yet allows you to demonstrate that you understand the knowledge from the week. Time to get started!</p>

          <p class="weeklyp"> Feeling really good about these first two weeks. I feel like I have learned an incredible amount in a really short amount of time and am having a lot of fun doing it. Time to study up on some Javascript, looking at the material before the lecture has been really helpful in not getting lost during lecture.</p>

      <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> - Sprint 2 - <span class="weeklytitle">Responsive Design and Preprocessors</span></h2>
      <p class = "intro">This week we learned how to use media queries to build websites that look good on devices of all sizes. We also learned how to use a preprocessor (LESS) to take our CSS skills to another level. Preprocessors are used to increase productivity and reduce errors in that it allows us to re-use codes by using variables and nesting. My favorite project this week was the personal resume page because I was able to throw it right on this website and it was fun to create. <a class = "lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

          <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">Responsive Design I - Layouts and Media Queries</span></h4>
          <p>Although this was technically a holiday we were still assigned a lecture the previous Friday and had up until the end of day 2 to finish the project. We learned what it means for a site to be fixed, fluid, adaptive or responsive and how to use media queries to make sites that we design behave and look as intended.  </p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 2:</span>  <span class="day">Responsive Design II - Fully Responsive </span></h4>
          <p>This was the official start of the week and we started at the beginning, going over many of the concepts from the intro video, but by the end we had learned how to make sites fully repsonsive using percent based values. It was very interesting to hear not only the technical side of coding but also the real world application of when to use a desktop first approach vs. a mobile first design. Great start to the week. </p>

          <h4><span class = "daytags">Day 3:</span>  <span class="day">Preprocessors I - LESS</span></h4>
          <p>We were introduced to the LESS syntax and learned how this is turned into CSS by a Javascript compiler. Once I saw LESS in action there was a real lightbulb moment and a lot of web development was demystified all at once. It became clear how you could organize all kinds of data and pages using this powerful tool. This was the day we created our digital resumes for daily project. </p>

          <p> In this sprint we updated a website using the responsive web design skills that we learned throughout the week. Portions of the website were provided and we were expected to match a desktop and mobile design using the LESS preprocessor and then submit a pull request using Github.</p>

          <p>Learned how to use the flexbox module with the box model to refactor the previous day's assignment and
            style a new page. It all started to make sense on this day! I realized that I had not made use of an
            overall "container" in the prior day's assignment. Reviewing the solution and the flexbox lecture cleared
