      <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> Project Week 1 - <span class="weeklytitle">Project Week - User Interface</span></h2>
      <p class="intro">This was my first Project Week as a Lambda School student. Project Week is a 4 day Sprint where
        you are working on your own to complete a project by a Thursday afternoon deadline. You are expected to use all
        of the skills and lessons given during the first 4 weeks to successfully complete the project. There were many
        pieces to the project and plenty of additional tasks to complete if you finished ahead of schedule. We were
        tasked with creating a full website with multiple pages and responsiveness for different devices. It needed
        multiple user interface functionalities that needed to work in order for the project to be considered
        successful. It was an intimidating task but I knew it was possible because there wasn't anything new other than
        doing everything we've done all in one project instead of one a small part where pieces are provided. This was
        all us from scratch other than some design files and styles. The project theme was an architectural design firm
        - <a href='./SJ-Associates/index.html''>S&J Associates </a> - website, we were tasked with a mobile and desktop design of the home page and a desktop design for
        the services page plus the header navigation and the tab navigator in the services page. The above link will take you
        to my completed project. <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">Project Setup and High Hopes</span></h4>
          <p>This was the day I started to outline my project and decided to go with a mobile first approach to
            challenge myself as every project we had done in the past was desktop first. I'
          m talking about whether you design your mobile or desktop first which affects how the view adjusts across
          devices. I printed and marked up my designs with HTML tags, organized my files, forked and cloned the Github
          project repository, built a Trello board with MVP (the essential items needed to get accomplished, 5 total)
          and stretch goals and started coding my mobile desktop page right after lunch. I finished the day with the
          mobile page about halfway finished. I felt confident that I could get most of the project done the following
          day but was a bit nervous that others (a small amount, but still) in my group had finished all of the main
          tasks in this one day.</p> </div> <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">The Main Page Mobile and Desktop Versions Take
              Shape </span></h4>
          <p>On this second day I struggled to finish the mobile and desktop pages by the end of the day. I truly
            appreciated the complexity of the design files we were given and also my own lack of practice in creating
            websites and using the tools at my disposal. I loved re-learning some things I had just done a few weeks
            ago and solidifying some of that knowledge that I had only recently gained. Even though I was done with 2/5
            tasks I now felt like I was falling behind but was pretty sure that I could finish the project with the 2
            days I had left but wasn't so sure that I could get it done by the following day anymore.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-content">
    <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Services Desktop is Finished and I Get Stuck Trying
        to Get My Navigation Overlay to Close</span></h4>
    <p>A breakthrough day for me. I finished most of my HTML and LESS for all the sites at all the breakpoints
      necessary for MVP and I started to focus on building the two functional Javascript components. I mostly
      finished one where the user clicks on the navigation and an overlay menu opens and then it closes when the
      user clicks the X. Sounds simple but I got stuck not getting the overlay to close and went to sleep
      dreaming about solutions. I found one as I was drifting to bed but was reminded of it the following day. I
      knew I had the whole day to implement a functional component that I had succesfully done in the past and to
      debug my almost done main navigator. I was 80% confident I would finish the project at all by the deadline.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-content">
    <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Pulling it All Together and Demo Day </span></h4>
    <p>I woke up and got right to coding knowing that at 2pm was Demo Time. I reached out to my Project Manager
      and told her of my progress and said that I might have to have a video conference to talk through my issue
      if I couldn't debug it myself. She gave me a nice tip on how she solved it and it sparked an aha moment of
      my thought the previous night. Once I got that fixed the remaining navigation component went quick and I
      finished the MVP tasks with a few hours to spare. I got it reviewed and after a quick modification I was
      good to go on trying some stretch tasks before final submittal. I was relieved and proud of myself for
      sticking with it and finishing on time.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="weeklyp">Now that project week is over and we have a 3-day weekend to reflect and look ahead I'm thankful
    and grateful for this experience. In 5 weeks I have a project on my own domain which I created with the skills that
    I picked up in a very short amount of time. Some of my classmates have some really incredible work which I'm super
    proud of and inspired by. Demo day was a good time to learn and see what's possible with more time and patience.
    Next week we begin to learn React and I am still planning on fixing some things on my S&J Architects page as well
    as getting around to implementing the tab navigator on this page and adding a Projects page to display S&J
    Associates. I also need to fix the mobile view of this page. See you next week if not sooner.</p>

    <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> - Sprint 4 - <span class="weeklytitle">Applied Javascript</span></h2>
    <p class="intro"> It's hard to believe that it has been a month already of Lambda School. We've come a long way.
      I am excited and slightly nervous about tomorrow's sprint challenge. I've struggled a bit this week to complete
      all of the projects. It's mostly been silly mistakes that send me down a path that leads to a new mistake and
      before long I've lost myself and am not sure where the problem is. I felt good Monday and Tuesday but
      Functional Programming has been a bit of a challenge. After doing some review I've noticed that most of my
      errors have been simple spelling mistakes or forgetting to closely check how to call the CSS on a query
      selector. I'll be on the lookout for that during tomrrow's sprint. <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">DOM I - Intro</span></h4>
        <p> I felt really good about this day and probably overconfident as we moved into Tuesday. I had done a fair
          amount of work over the weekend watching the previous cohort's lecture and starting the project. I didn't
          appreciate the subtle difference between query and element selectors which cost me heading into Wednesday
          but I learned a lot on this day. We learned that the DOM stands for the Document Object Model which is an
          object representation of the HTML of a website that is a tree structure that can be traversed and used to
          give functionality to websites. The things you can do once you learn this are amazing and I couldn't wait
          to try the stretch project (a timer that I want to convert into my own jiu-jitsu round timer). A great
          start to the week. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">DOM II - Events & Propagation </span></h4>
        <p>This was great, we learned how websites listen for events (such as a mouseclick) and respond to that event
          in some way. We place what are called event listeners on our DOM elements. There were tons to play with.
          The project entailed adding some to a project we had worked on previously, the Fun Bus Website. I had a
          good time changing things and learning how to make websites interactive. I did not get to the stretch task
          on this day and I started to get a bit lost using query selectors to work with some of the event listeners
          that I was trying to implement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Components I - Intro</span></h4>
        <p>We began to learn about components and functional programming as an overall theme. I found the material to
          be really cool because it allows you to do so much on a website with the skills we have learned so far.
          Components use HTML, CSS, and Javascript as a chunk of code that can be used to give a website
          functionality. This was the day we brought it all home and learned how to use objects as classes to target
          various parts of a website using any methods we wanted. I loved how our project solved a question I was
          grappling with on this very blog which was, how do I organize all these posts in a way that a user can
          quickly read what he wants and hide the rest? Components. I failed at completing the project on time due
          mainly to silly mistakes and typos but I'm starting to see it come together.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Components II- Class Syntax and Data Attributes
          </span></h4>
        <p>Learning how to make classes interact and dance with class syntax and data attributes. So here we are now
          able to pass data from our HTML to our CSS/Javascript using data attributes. One application of this could
          be linking different components on a website that share behavior. I, again, failed to complete the project
          on time. Again, silly mistakes. I didn't catch a capitalization error which was giving me a headache and I
          added a period to a class selector that didn't need it. I'm hoping I don't make the same mistakes tomorrow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint Challenge 4 - Applied Javascript</span></h4>
        <p> In this sprint we are completing challenges similar to what we've been working on all week. We'll see how
          this goes.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp"> Sprint was good this week. I finished the basics with about 20 minutes to spare. There were
        definitely some moments of uncertainty but I had a huge breakthrough in this challenge. I was able to
        successfully debug my program using the debugger tools we had been shown this week. They were so clutch in
        getting the logic to work as I wanted. It felt amazing to figure something out that I had struggled with all
        week. I spent the next few days tinkering with the stretch goal of getting the an image carousel to work and
        got that done today. The project itself was to create functionality to a website that behaved like the LA
        Times page. Naturally it was called the Lambda Times. What I really loved is that this week gave an an answer
        to a question I had which was how to display the contents of this blog in a more organized way. Use
        components! Going to restyle the site over the next week using all we've learned. This upcoming week is a
        4-day long Sprint challenge where we take all our training for the past month and put it all to use. We got a
        preview on Friday and it all looks very do-able. Looking forward to next week and beyond.</p>

    <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> - Sprint 3 - <span class="weeklytitle">JavaScript Fundamentals</span></h2>
    <p class="intro"> This week we started to learn JavaScript. It was great to see how JavaScript connects with HTML
      and CSS to produce content we see on web pages and applications across the internet. My favorite activity of
      the week was adding content to the start of a text-based RPG using the JavaScript skills I had been learning
      throughout the week. <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript I - Fundamentals</span></h4>
        <p> We got into it right away on day 1. We covered some of the basics in the first hour of the lecture:
          variables and arrays and then moved onto objects and functions in the 2nd hour.

          Presently to be accepted to Lambda School you have to complete the pre-course work which included a lot of
          this JavaScript material or pass the Lambda Challenge which is an on-line JavaScript test essentially.
          Luckily I had already completed Khan Academy's Javascript section which was extremely helpful in getting me
          to pass the Lamba Challenge but was also a great foundation for this week's content, especially once we got
          to object methods and classes.

          We wrapped this day up talking about the differences between 'function scope' and 'block scope' and
          completed a project where we created objects and used array methods to retrieve specific information from a
          large data array. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript II - Closure, Callbacks & Advanced Array
            Methods </span></h4>
        <p>On day 2 we covered the concept of closure, callback and introduced advanced array methods to simplify our
          work from the previous day. This was a bit confusing at first but once I started to practice and fix my
          mistakes it was easier than I thought. Closure simply refers to a function within a function, this function
          will have access to its own variables and methods and those of its parent function but the parent will not
          have access to the child's attributes or methods. A callback refers to a function that references another
          function which it needs in order to run. Advanced array methods such as .filter, .map & .reduce are ways to
          go through an array and pull meaningful data in various ways. The part of the project which was a bit tough
          for me today was creating a counter function that increments each time it is called. Once I saw my mistake
          in implementation the concept of closure became a lot clearer. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript III - 'this' Keyword</span></h4>
        <p>Here we learned how to use the 'this' keyword to interact with the objects we create in JavaScript. The
          four types of binding for 'this' are: Implicit, Explicit, New & Window. Implicit binds 'this' to whatever
          is to the left of the dot when 'this' is used. Explicit binding is when 'this' is bound to a function
          method (using call(), apply() or bind()). You can use a functions 'this' scope as the context when you call
          or apply (to array) it. Bind is used to store a 'this' for later use. New is used to bind 'this' to new
          objects created by Constructor Functions. Binds 'this' to the constructor function object. Finally, Window
          binds the 'this' keyword to a global or window-scope.
        </p>

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript IV - Refactoring and the Class Keyword
          </span></h4>
        <p>Major 'aha' moment for me on this day. Seeing our objects we've been working with this week transform
          using the Class keyword made closure and inheritance seem way easier than they looked at the beginning of
          the week. The structure is nicer and made my coding go at a much faster rate. Our project involved
          refactoring (converting) our constructors into ES6 classes from the previous day's project and using our
          new skills to create a "school" in Javascript using different classes and methods (for Instructors,
          Students and Project Managers). I feel ready for today's Sprint Challenge now.</p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint Challenge 3 - Assessing Your JavaScript
            Fundamentals</span></h4>
        <p> In this sprint we are completing challenges similar to what we've been working on all week. Should be
          pretty straightforward. There hasn't been anything tricky or different from what we've been covering each
          week in these Sprint Challenges which makes them challenging yet allows you to demonstrate that you
          understand the knowledge from the week. Time to get started!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp"> Sprint 3 is finished. I completed all tasks with a few minutes to spare and completed the
        stretch goal 8 minutes past the hour. There were some tricky portions but it was more of myself overthinking
        what I had just learned rather than the problems themselves being tough. JavaScript fundamentals was tough
        but I learned a lot this week as I have every week of this Lambda experience. </p>

    <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> - Sprint 2 - <span class="weeklytitle">Responsive Design and Preprocessors</span></h2>
    <p class="intro">This week we learned how to use media queries to build websites that look good on devices of all
      sizes. We also learned how to use a preprocessor (LESS) to take our CSS skills to another level. Preprocessors
      are used to increase productivity and reduce errors in that it allows us to re-use codes by using variables and
      nesting. My favorite project this week was the personal resume page because I was able to throw it right on
      this website and it was fun to create. <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

        <p>Although this was technically a holiday we were still assigned a lecture the previous Friday and had up
          until the end of day 2 to finish the project. We learned what it means for a site to be fixed, fluid,
          adaptive or responsive and how to use media queries to make sites that we design behave and look as
          intended. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">Responsive Design II - Fully Responsive </span></h4>
        <p>This was the official start of the week and we started at the beginning, going over many of the concepts
          from the intro video, but by the end we had learned how to make sites fully repsonsive using percent based
          values. It was very interesting to hear not only the technical side of coding but also the real world
          application of when to use a desktop first approach vs. a mobile first design. Great start to the week. </p>

        <p>We were introduced to the LESS syntax and learned how this is turned into CSS by a Javascript compiler.
          Once I saw LESS in action there was a real lightbulb moment and a lot of web development was demystified
          all at once. It became clear how you could organize all kinds of data and pages using this powerful tool.
