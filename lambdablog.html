      <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> Sprint 8 - <span class="weeklytitle">Single Page Applications</span></h2>
      <p class="intro"> This week we focused on learning two packages with React: Axios and React Router. Now that I've
        had 3 weeks working with React I'm starting to get comfortable building with it. Being able to start a local
        server and interact with the data was fascinating to use, and simple too now that I have more reps under my belt. I'm finally starting to appreciate how useful
        React can truly be. <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">React Router I</span></h4>
          <p> We started the week learning the difference between client-side routing and server-side routing. The pros
            and cons of having all your data brought in at the beginning vs pinging a server and having your page
            reload with each request. We then started to learn and implement the Client Side Routing Library (React
            Router). This gave us the ability to create dynamic routes using URL parameters to display our components
            with whatever user interaction we needed. Being able to match items to URL paths and seeing how easy it was
            gave e a great sigh of relief after a tough two weeks. We had two projects to complete over the next two
            days relating to this topic. I finished the first pretty quickly that day and left about half the second
            project for the next day. A smooth start to the week. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-content">

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">React Router II - Sub-routes and Link/NavLink
            </span></h4>
          <p>This day we dove deeper into React Router and although it was a bit more intense (content-wise) I was still able to follow along. Looking back I didn't appreciate how the render prop or the history object was used until it came time for the sprint. With React Router you can pass data to components via the render prop, I didn't really understand what this meant until Friday. I was also confused with the history object that React Router has but it all cleared up on Friday. I truly appreciate React Router and its intricacies until I had used it for a few days in a row. I finished my project but didn't hit stretch goals. I felt at the time like I understood the basics but still needed practice to be able to implement any of the stretch goals we were given. Link and NavLink are used in React Router to link as the names imply but NavLink can add an active-class to a selection which is awesome for styling purposes. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">HTTP/AJAX I</span></h4>
          <p>On day 3 of this week we learned what AJAX meant (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and learned how to perform requests to an external server in order to retrieve, create, modify, or remove information. We were also introduced to Axios which is a library for performing promise based HTTP requests. These promises are what allow you to make multiple asynchronous requests and continue with your apps operation until those requests are fulfilled or rejected. It was pretty straightforward but the project we were using to explain the concept was pretty complex and interesting. We learned our request via a web store applications whose items we could add, edit, or remove. Cool to see the concepts we were learning in an actual application. Although some if it wasn't clear in real time seeing the videos again and being able to pause and follow along was key for me. I realize through this journey that I'm not great during live lectures. I try my best to keep up but if I mess up a keystroke or for whatever reason don't follow along for a few minutes I'll be lost and just watching along instead of coding for myself. I much prefer watching a prerecorded lecture where I could go at my own pace. That's just a personal preference. I appreciate the live lectures 100% but I know that moving forward I will appreciate them way more knowing that I don't always have to keep up and can and should be instead going back and watching at my own pace at a future time. Or, even better, a cool thing about Lambda School is that the previous cohort's videos are available for us to watch. So instead of going through the training kit and trying to read and do the exercises this week, instead I watched all the videos from prior cohort's lectures and followed through those. When it came time for our live lecture I got lost (coding along) as expected but I had already seen and understood the material so I wasn't stressing. I was still able to do the projects because I had put in the time to watch and code along to the exercises the night before, same instructor and everything! I love the ability to play a video at 2x or pause for 20+ minutes if needed. Especially with all the new content we are consistently learning.

        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">HTTP / AJAX II - Axios</span></h4>
          <p>We finished our online store demo using Axios to add, modify and delete items. I completed my project for the day but I wasn't able to hit stretch or delete/modify my entry. It wasn't required for our sprint the following day but it is something that I'm working on learning. I also am at 90% on Code Academy's second React course which helped clear a few things up again this week, have to mention it as a fun learning tool that I'm using along with Lambda School.  </p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 8 - React (SPA) Smurfs</span></h4>
          <p>This project was fun. We built out a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application that consumes an API to update Smurfs being shown on screen. I hit MVP way before time was up and I was surprised at how well I had done compared to the two previous weeks. I even hit a stretch goal of implementing a delete feature. POST is still tricky for me to implement on a solo project but it is something I"ll have down by project week with lots more practice to come. </p>
        </div>
        <p class="weeklyp">2 months later and I have no doubts that I made the right decision with Lambda School. I'm learning more than ever before and couldn't of asked for a better experience. Next week we are learning Redux which is a state management system and then we have our week long project week for this front end section of the curriculum. This is going by so fast!</p>

      <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> Sprint 7 - <span class="weeklytitle">Intermediate React</span></h2>
      <p class="intro">This week we learned some more advanced React techniques and worked on a week long project to
        create the User Interface for an Instagram Clone. It was definitely the toughest week by far but at the same
        time I feel like my preparation and truly trusting the process helped me successfully finish this week's Sprint
        challenge which seemed daunting just a few days ago. I also pair programmed for the first time this week which
        was a fun learning experience and something that I need to go out of my way to do more of. <a class="lambda"

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">React Tooling</span></h4>
          <p>We had this day off for Indigenous People's Day but we were expected to complete Day 1 & Day 2 parts of
            the week-long project by end of day Tuesday so we were still expected to have Day 1 work done by Tuesday
            morning.
            We were free to do this anytime starting Friday afternoon. I spent the weekend working on Code Academy's
            React part 1 course because I still felt a bit shaky and I'm glad I did. It was a confidence boost #1
            because I was amazed at how much I
            already knew and but #2 I was able to appreciated some things that I missed or just saw in a different
            light going through these
            exercises. I got through the course over the weekend and while it definitely holds your hand a bit too much
            and is not as deep as the Lambda projects I appreciated going over the basics one more time. Learn from
            wherever you can. Anyway, on
            Monday I started and mostly finished the project for the day. The content was all about setting up a React
            project on your local machine. It seemed a bit redundant since many of the tutorials when we started React
            were on this topic but I can see why it was necessary to go over this since we had been in a code sandbox
            for the previous week (at least for instruction). We also went over how to use PropTypes to 'type check'
            data being passed to our components. Basically putting a check into our code for ourselves and future
            developers to know the type of data that a component expects. I didn't appreciate how useful this would be
            until later in the week.</p>

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">The React Lifecycle
            </span></h4>
          <p>Whooo... this was a topic that felt like we could've spent a week on to get good at or maybe that's just
            me. The React Lifecycle refers to every component in React having a lifecycle. It's not a complicated
            concept, a piece of UI is created, used, and terminated/deathed when it has served its function. There's a
            lot however going on under the hood and some new methods were introduced that React components can use to
            manipulate
            data and share it amongst other components. We were expected to use these newly taught skills to make our
            Instagram Clone come alive and be able to add comments to posts and increase the like count by clicking on
            the hearts. This seemed pretty straight forward before React but now we needed to set a state and pass it
            down? I understood during lecture but in practice I was struggling. Luckily I picked the perfect day to
            pair program. I had a good conversation the previous week with one of my peers in the cohort during our
            code review and we were both struggling then so I suggested we tag team this project in the afternoon after
            lecture. Luckily he agreed and we struggled through it together. We didn't successfully implement the add
            comment functionality but we got close! Luckily I have some awesome people in my smaller group that I meet
            with daily during stand-up and they were able to explain how they solved the problem which showed me where
            my mistake was. I felt shaky but ready for day 3 after reviewing the solution code for the day and looking
            at the following day's material.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">React Composition Patterns</span></h4>
          <p>This was another topic which felt like I could've spent way more time on (...and I plan to!). A Higher
            Ordered Component (HOC) is pattern seen in React that gives reusability to component logic. It is a
            function that receives a component as an argument and returns a component. The name is a bit misleading in
            that respect. Our Day 3 project with this concept was to implement an authorization page on our Instagram
            Clone using a Higher Order Component. Once again the lecture felt smooth and I felt ready to implement but
            it was definitely tricky and I didn't finish on time. I did get a chance to review the previous day's
            solution and started to get a better sense for how React works. I can't say how thankful I am to have great
            peers in my group who do a great job of explaining their work and my project manager as well who is
            encouraging and helfpul in answering our questions or finding somebody who will. I was starting to feel a
            little bit nervous about the upcoming Sprint Challenge on Friday after having failed to finish my project
            in time for two days in a row but I took solace in being able to read the solution and be able to follow
            along during lecture.

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">CSS in JS - Styled Components</span></h4>
          <p>Day 4 brought a well-received 'easy' topic with Styled Components. Having the ability to style your
            components from within your React file looked really cool when it was demonstrated and it was super simple
            to implement. It's really fascinating to see the different ways there are to do the same thing and having
            the ability to pick and choose based on the situation or your personal preference. This day's project was
            pretty easy - refactor the previous day's page to use styled components. I spent most of the day reviewing
            HOC material from the day before. I didn't feel 'ready' for the Sprint but I was confident that either way
            I had learned a lot this week and was reminded by a peer that two weeks ago I didn't even know what React
            was.</p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 7 - React Lambda Times</span></h4>
          <p>This project brought back a previous project we had worked on when we were learning about Functional
            Components - The Lambda Times. Our task was to refactor our prior project using React. Most of the code was
            built out for us but there was definitely a lot for us to do! I hacked away at it and was mostly done by
            the time 11am hit. If I haven't mentioned it before you are expected to work on your sprint from 8-11am
            PST. I was stuck getting my articles to update based on my selected tab. I was growing frustrated but I
            knew I was close. I told my project manager that I would wrap up shortly after lunch. After getting some
            food in me I got back to it and after plenty of console logging and React debugging I got it to work! I
            guess I
            knew some React after all.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="weeklyp">This was definitely one of the most fulfilling weeks in my time at Lambda School. I
          struggled but I knew that the concepts would come with practice and time. Plus if you are struggling then it
          definitely means that you are learning. I was super happy to pull this week's project off and am off to prep
          for next week's material on... let's see... Single Page Applications using React Router and HTTP/AJAX... umm
          time to go read

      <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> Sprint 6 - <span class="weeklytitle">Introduction to React</span></h2>
      <p class="intro">This week was all about React. React is a UI library that was developed by Facebook that allows
        you to create small, reusable pieces of UI that can be put together to make larger applications. There wasn't
        anything tough conceptually but it was a lot at once this week and I struggled with some of the syntax and how
        to apply state across my components. A tough week but I got through it and after putting in sometime this
        weekend to review I feel better heading into week 7.<a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">Functional Components I</span></h4>
          <p>We started the week with the basics, what is React and what potential problems does it address? I touched
            on this in the intro but the answer is data. React is a way to interact will all the potential ways a user
            can use the application and interact or provide data and have that application re-render in an efficient
            way. React allows us to do this using Components. I finished the day 1
            project on time which was to use JSX to create a social card which was a copy of a Twitter Tweet. Fun to
            see on a day 1 project. </p>

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">Functional Components II
              Shape </span></h4>
          <p>Day 2's focus was on the use of props in React and how tio implement the map function to loop through an
            array and display multiple elements at once or just loop through data that would be given or needed to be
            used in an application. We created a calculator application without the functionality (that was stretch) as
            our project and I finished MVP on time. Tuesday was the day that I attended my first Lambda School
            after-hours from 6-8pm PST. After-hours are on Tuesday and Thursdays and they are an extra Q&A session with
            an instructor who goes over questions or just gives more examples. I was feeling a little bit overwhelmed
            with the new info and decided to attend and I'm glad I did. I cleared up a lot of misconceptions I had and
            reinforced some of the material from the morning lecture.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Class Components I</span></h4>
          <p>We talked about Class Components which are unique to React and are how we manage our data and user
            interaction. Introducing state and passing that down to the components. I should mention that we got a new
            instructor this week (every 5 weeks at Lambda School for each new unit) and the lectures have been good. I
            follow along content-wise but when it came to implementing this day's project I got a bit tripped up. The
            task was to create functional to-do list. This involved having to take user input and interaction. I
            realized that a majority of my problems were simple spelling errors "do" vs. "Do" or a misuse of syntax. I
            was ok knowing that I could understand my peers work during standup.</p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Class Components II</span></h4>
          <p>Our project for the day was to finish our calculator project from the previous day. The lecture got into
            nested components and further instructions on how to use setState to control how your components are
            rendered on screen. I stayed for a 2nd after hours because I was still struggling with getting my events to
            work and my app to do what I wanted it to do. After reviewing the solution code I realized that I needed to
            brush up on my basic Javascript if I wanted to be successful with React.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 6 - React Wars</span></h4>
          <p>This project was easier than our calculator App but something about it was still giving me issues. We had
            to take data and render it to our screen in React. The data was from a Star Wars API which was awesome to
            use a real API in a project that I was creating. Seemed easy enough, I had done this multiple times
            throughout the course of the week. One thing slowed me down. I didn't pass down my props in my render
            function to my components! After carefully reviewing some similar projects I was able to finish on time and
            submit a product. I didn't hit stretch but I knew I had to spend some time over this 3 day weekend to brush
            up and really figure out where I went wrong. This blog goes a long way in clearing out those thoughts and
            figuring it out. </p>
        </div>
        <p class="weeklyp">I spent some time this weekend on Code Academy in their React section. There were definitely
          some gaps in my understanding on the fundamentals and I feel way better about this upcoming week. I know we
          have another week-long project and I am ready to jump in knowing what to do and ready to execute. I'm going
          to look into peer programming for a bit this week so that I don't get stuck doing this by myself. I feel like
          I can solve my problems faster by just talking things through with somebody else. Next week we are building
          an Instagram clone in React learning new material such as prop checking and component styling.</p>

      <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> Project Week 1 - <span class="weeklytitle">Project Week - User Interface</span></h2>
      <p class="intro">This was my first Project Week as a Lambda School student. Project Week is a 4 day Sprint where
        you are working on your own to complete a project by a Thursday afternoon deadline. You are expected to use all
        of the skills and lessons given during the first 4 weeks to successfully complete the project. There were many
        pieces to the project and plenty of additional tasks to complete if you finished ahead of schedule. We were
        tasked with creating a full website with multiple pages and responsiveness for different devices. It needed
        multiple user interface functionalities that needed to work in order for the project to be considered
        successful. It was an intimidating task but I knew it was possible because there wasn't anything new other than
        doing everything we've done all in one project instead of one a small part where pieces are provided. This was
        all us from scratch other than some design files and styles. The project theme was an architectural design firm
        - <a href='./SJ-Associates/index.html''>S&J Associates </a> - website, we were tasked with a mobile and desktop design of the home page and a desktop design for
        the services page plus the header navigation and the tab navigator in the services page. The above link will take you
        to my completed project. <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">Project Setup and High Hopes</span></h4>
          <p>This was the day I started to outline my project and decided to go with a mobile first approach to
            challenge myself as every project we had done in the past was desktop first. I'
          m talking about whether you design your mobile or desktop first which affects how the view adjusts across
          devices. I printed and marked up my designs with HTML tags, organized my files, forked and cloned the Github
          project repository, built a Trello board with MVP (the essential items needed to get accomplished, 5 total)
          and stretch goals and started coding my mobile desktop page right after lunch. I finished the day with the
          mobile page about halfway finished. I felt confident that I could get most of the project done the following
          day but was a bit nervous that others (a small amount, but still) in my group had finished all of the main
          tasks in this one day.</p> </div> <div class="text-content">
          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">The Main Page Mobile and Desktop Versions Take
              Shape </span></h4>
          <p>On this second day I struggled to finish the mobile and desktop pages by the end of the day. I truly
            appreciated the complexity of the design files we were given and also my own lack of practice in creating
            websites and using the tools at my disposal. I loved re-learning some things I had just done a few weeks
            ago and solidifying some of that knowledge that I had only recently gained. Even though I was done with 2/5
            tasks I now felt like I was falling behind but was pretty sure that I could finish the project with the 2
            days I had left but wasn't so sure that I could get it done by the following day anymore.</p>

  <div class="text-content">
    <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Services Desktop is Finished and I Get Stuck Trying
        to Get My Navigation Overlay to Close</span></h4>
    <p>A breakthrough day for me. I finished most of my HTML and LESS for all the sites at all the breakpoints
      necessary for MVP and I started to focus on building the two functional Javascript components. I mostly
      finished one where the user clicks on the navigation and an overlay menu opens and then it closes when the
      user clicks the X. Sounds simple but I got stuck not getting the overlay to close and went to sleep
      dreaming about solutions. I found one as I was drifting to bed but was reminded of it the following day. I
      knew I had the whole day to implement a functional component that I had succesfully done in the past and to
      debug my almost done main navigator. I was 80% confident I would finish the project at all by the deadline.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-content">
    <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Pulling it All Together and Demo Day </span></h4>
    <p>I woke up and got right to coding knowing that at 2pm was Demo Time. I reached out to my Project Manager
      and told her of my progress and said that I might have to have a video conference to talk through my issue
      if I couldn't debug it myself. She gave me a nice tip on how she solved it and it sparked an aha moment of
      my thought the previous night. Once I got that fixed the remaining navigation component went quick and I
      finished the MVP tasks with a few hours to spare. I got it reviewed and after a quick modification I was
      good to go on trying some stretch tasks before final submittal. I was relieved and proud of myself for
      sticking with it and finishing on time.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="weeklyp">Now that project week is over and we have a 3-day weekend to reflect and look ahead I'm
    thankful
    and grateful for this experience. In 5 weeks I have a project on my own domain which I created with the
    skills that
    I picked up in a very short amount of time. Some of my classmates have some really incredible work which I'm
    super
    proud of and inspired by. Demo day was a good time to learn and see what's possible with more time and
    patience.
    Next week we begin to learn React and I am still planning on fixing some things on my S&J Architects page as
    well
    as getting around to implementing the tab navigator on this page and adding a Projects page to display S&J
    Associates. I also need to fix the mobile view of this page. See you next week if not sooner.</p>

    <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> - Sprint 4 - <span class="weeklytitle">Applied Javascript</span></h2>
    <p class="intro"> It's hard to believe that it has been a month already of Lambda School. We've come a long way.
      I am excited and slightly nervous about tomorrow's sprint challenge. I've struggled a bit this week to complete
      all of the projects. It's mostly been silly mistakes that send me down a path that leads to a new mistake and
      before long I've lost myself and am not sure where the problem is. I felt good Monday and Tuesday but
      Functional Programming has been a bit of a challenge. After doing some review I've noticed that most of my
      errors have been simple spelling mistakes or forgetting to closely check how to call the CSS on a query
      selector. I'll be on the lookout for that during tomrrow's sprint. <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">DOM I - Intro</span></h4>
        <p> I felt really good about this day and probably overconfident as we moved into Tuesday. I had done a fair
          amount of work over the weekend watching the previous cohort's lecture and starting the project. I didn't
          appreciate the subtle difference between query and element selectors which cost me heading into Wednesday
          but I learned a lot on this day. We learned that the DOM stands for the Document Object Model which is an
          object representation of the HTML of a website that is a tree structure that can be traversed and used to
          give functionality to websites. The things you can do once you learn this are amazing and I couldn't wait
          to try the stretch project (a timer that I want to convert into my own jiu-jitsu round timer). A great
          start to the week. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">DOM II - Events & Propagation </span></h4>
        <p>This was great, we learned how websites listen for events (such as a mouseclick) and respond to that event
          in some way. We place what are called event listeners on our DOM elements. There were tons to play with.
          The project entailed adding some to a project we had worked on previously, the Fun Bus Website. I had a
          good time changing things and learning how to make websites interactive. I did not get to the stretch task
          on this day and I started to get a bit lost using query selectors to work with some of the event listeners
          that I was trying to implement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Components I - Intro</span></h4>
        <p>We began to learn about components and functional programming as an overall theme. I found the material to
          be really cool because it allows you to do so much on a website with the skills we have learned so far.
          Components use HTML, CSS, and Javascript as a chunk of code that can be used to give a website
          functionality. This was the day we brought it all home and learned how to use objects as classes to target
          various parts of a website using any methods we wanted. I loved how our project solved a question I was
          grappling with on this very blog which was, how do I organize all these posts in a way that a user can
          quickly read what he wants and hide the rest? Components. I failed at completing the project on time due
          mainly to silly mistakes and typos but I'm starting to see it come together.

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Components II- Class Syntax and Data Attributes
          </span></h4>
        <p>Learning how to make classes interact and dance with class syntax and data attributes. So here we are now
          able to pass data from our HTML to our CSS/Javascript using data attributes. One application of this could
          be linking different components on a website that share behavior. I, again, failed to complete the project
          on time. Again, silly mistakes. I didn't catch a capitalization error which was giving me a headache and I
          added a period to a class selector that didn't need it. I'm hoping I don't make the same mistakes tomorrow.</p>

        <p> In this sprint we are completing challenges similar to what we've been working on all week. We'll see how
          this goes.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp"> Sprint was good this week. I finished the basics with about 20 minutes to spare. There were
        definitely some moments of uncertainty but I had a huge breakthrough in this challenge. I was able to
        successfully debug my program using the debugger tools we had been shown this week. They were so clutch in
        getting the logic to work as I wanted. It felt amazing to figure something out that I had struggled with all
        week. I spent the next few days tinkering with the stretch goal of getting the an image carousel to work and
        got that done today. The project itself was to create functionality to a website that behaved like the LA
        Times page. Naturally it was called the Lambda Times. What I really loved is that this week gave an an answer
        to a question I had which was how to display the contents of this blog in a more organized way. Use
        components! Going to restyle the site over the next week using all we've learned. This upcoming week is a
        4-day long Sprint challenge where we take all our training for the past month and put it all to use. We got a
        preview on Friday and it all looks very do-able. Looking forward to next week and beyond.</p>

    <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> - Sprint 3 - <span class="weeklytitle">JavaScript Fundamentals</span></h2>
    <p class="intro"> This week we started to learn JavaScript. It was great to see how JavaScript connects with HTML
      and CSS to produce content we see on web pages and applications across the internet. My favorite activity of
      the week was adding content to the start of a text-based RPG using the JavaScript skills I had been learning
      throughout the week. <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript I - Fundamentals</span></h4>
        <p> We got into it right away on day 1. We covered some of the basics in the first hour of the lecture:
          variables and arrays and then moved onto objects and functions in the 2nd hour.

          Presently to be accepted to Lambda School you have to complete the pre-course work which included a lot of
          this JavaScript material or pass the Lambda Challenge which is an on-line JavaScript test essentially.
          Luckily I had already completed Khan Academy's Javascript section which was extremely helpful in getting me
          to pass the Lamba Challenge but was also a great foundation for this week's content, especially once we got
          to object methods and classes.

          We wrapped this day up talking about the differences between 'function scope' and 'block scope' and
          completed a project where we created objects and used array methods to retrieve specific information from a
          large data array. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript II - Closure, Callbacks & Advanced Array
            Methods </span></h4>
        <p>On day 2 we covered the concept of closure, callback and introduced advanced array methods to simplify our
          work from the previous day. This was a bit confusing at first but once I started to practice and fix my
          mistakes it was easier than I thought. Closure simply refers to a function within a function, this function
          will have access to its own variables and methods and those of its parent function but the parent will not
          have access to the child's attributes or methods. A callback refers to a function that references another
          function which it needs in order to run. Advanced array methods such as .filter, .map & .reduce are ways to
          go through an array and pull meaningful data in various ways. The part of the project which was a bit tough
          for me today was creating a counter function that increments each time it is called. Once I saw my mistake
          in implementation the concept of closure became a lot clearer. </p>

      <div class="text-content">
        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript III - 'this' Keyword</span></h4>
        <p>Here we learned how to use the 'this' keyword to interact with the objects we create in JavaScript. The
          four types of binding for 'this' are: Implicit, Explicit, New & Window. Implicit binds 'this' to whatever
          is to the left of the dot when 'this' is used. Explicit binding is when 'this' is bound to a function
          method (using call(), apply() or bind()). You can use a functions 'this' scope as the context when you call
          or apply (to array) it. Bind is used to store a 'this' for later use. New is used to bind 'this' to new
          objects created by Constructor Functions. Binds 'this' to the constructor function object. Finally, Window
          binds the 'this' keyword to a global or window-scope.

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">JavaScript IV - Refactoring and the Class Keyword
          </span></h4>
        <p>Major 'aha' moment for me on this day. Seeing our objects we've been working with this week transform
          using the Class keyword made closure and inheritance seem way easier than they looked at the beginning of
          the week. The structure is nicer and made my coding go at a much faster rate. Our project involved
          refactoring (converting) our constructors into ES6 classes from the previous day's project and using our
          new skills to create a "school" in Javascript using different classes and methods (for Instructors,
          Students and Project Managers). I feel ready for today's Sprint Challenge now.</p>

        <p> In this sprint we are completing challenges similar to what we've been working on all week. Should be
          pretty straightforward. There hasn't been anything tricky or different from what we've been covering each
          week in these Sprint Challenges which makes them challenging yet allows you to demonstrate that you
          understand the knowledge from the week. Time to get started!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="weeklyp"> Sprint 3 is finished. I completed all tasks with a few minutes to spare and completed the
        stretch goal 8 minutes past the hour. There were some tricky portions but it was more of myself overthinking
        what I had just learned rather than the problems themselves being tough. JavaScript fundamentals was tough
        but I learned a lot this week as I have every week of this Lambda experience. </p>

    <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> - Sprint 2 - <span class="weeklytitle">Responsive Design and Preprocessors</span></h2>
    <p class="intro">This week we learned how to use media queries to build websites that look good on devices of all
      sizes. We also learned how to use a preprocessor (LESS) to take our CSS skills to another level. Preprocessors
      are used to increase productivity and reduce errors in that it allows us to re-use codes by using variables and
      nesting. My favorite project this week was the personal resume page because I was able to throw it right on
      this website and it was fun to create. <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

        <p>Although this was technically a holiday we were still assigned a lecture the previous Friday and had up
          until the end of day 2 to finish the project. We learned what it means for a site to be fixed, fluid,
          adaptive or responsive and how to use media queries to make sites that we design behave and look as
          intended. </p>

        <p>This was the official start of the week and we started at the beginning, going over many of the concepts
          from the intro video, but by the end we had learned how to make sites fully repsonsive using percent based
          values. It was very interesting to hear not only the technical side of coding but also the real world

          Once I saw LESS in action there was a real lightbulb moment and a lot of web development was demystified
          all at once. It became clear how you could organize all kinds of data and pages using this powerful tool.
