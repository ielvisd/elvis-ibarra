    <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> Sprint 13 - <span class="weeklytitle">Authentication</span></h2>
<p class="intro">

    Two weeks have passed since my last post, I will talk about what I worked on over Thanksgiving break and then jump into what week 13 at Lambda School was like. Over the week long break I started to work on a project that a few of my peers in my small group and myself thought of to push ourselves further and keep our skills sharp. This was a great experience as it gave me a taste of what it would be like to work in a team and also gave me practice reading documentation and implementing something that I did not know how to do before. I learned how to use the YouTube API with a JSON web token to make requests on a user's behalf using permissions from their YouTube account. We decided to build an app using React and although we didn't get a finished product we have a solid start and I will definitely post more details as we develop this further.  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learn to program <a href="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LambdaSchool</a>‚ù§Ô∏è Awesome curriculum, instructors, pm&#39;s, students &amp; no tuition until after you&#39;ve graduated and are hiredü§Ø Sign up with my ambassador link üî•<a href="https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL">https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL</a>üî• if you are interested!

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1: </span> <span class="day">Introduction to Authentication & First Day as a Part-Time Project Manager (PM)
    
            </span></h4>
            <p> Authentication is definitely a complex topic but the introductory lecture made starting the afternoon project pretty straight forward. We got a big overview as to what authentication was and were given some good guidelines and best practices for things we should be thinking about when we work on authentication projects. One of the things we learned how to do is use a library to hash passwords before saving them to a database. I was able to follow along with the lecture and finish the MVP for day 1 of our first 2- day project of the week.  </p>
            <p> In the afternoon I started day 1 as a PM for the Full Stack Web Development Part-Time 4 cohort. I'm using it as an opportunity to see the curriculum through a new lens, network with more Lambda peers, and get some real world experience working in tech. I have a great group of students and look forward to helping them get through Lambda and to see their growth as the weeks go by. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2: </span> <span class="day">Using Sessions and Cookies
          </span></h4>
        <p> This was a very enlightening day in terms of the new information I picked up and what I learned about how the internet operates. I had heard of sessions/cookies before and had a rough idea of what they did before Lambda but I had never bothered to really research them or learn how to use them. To describe what they do, they allow you to retain information about your client so that they do not need to log back in if you don't need them to and their information will still be shown to them upon returning to the site. After this lecture I felt everything coming together and could see myself delivering a full website experience using everything I've learned so far. It was a great feeling. The lecture made it so that you could complete your project if you followed along so it wasn't too bad to hit MVP for this day. I definitely feel like I need more practice in general but I for sure am getting that each and every day. üòÑ  </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</span></h4>
                <p>We started another 2 day project on day 3 of this week where we began to learn how to add authentication to an API using JSON web tokens (JWTs) and creating a React App that would use this authentication. The lectured focused on JWTs, what they are and how to use them. I learned that a JWT has three parts; a header, a payload and a verify signature. We discussed how to use that token to authenticate a user and I was able to finish day 1 MVP by following along with the lecture. This was the same material that I had done on my own when working on my Thanksgiving project the week before so I thought that was kind of cool.

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Client Side Authentication</span></h4>
        <p>This was definitely the meatiest day of the week in my opinion because we had to take all our authentication knowledge and combine it with all our React knowledge to create a functional app that would authenticate a user using a JWT. With JWTs the client is responsible for holding onto the token and sending it on every request. I re-watched the lecture and followed along closely changing items that were unique to my server. I didn't finish on time but I was able to wrap up right as my PT job as PM was about to start. I felt ready for the Sprint and did not do a review for this one (mistake!)    </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 13 - Authentication (RDBMS)</span></h4>
        <p> This sprint challenged us to implement a User Authentication System that used the bcrypt libary and a JWT. Had I written my review beforehand I would not have gotten tripped up by some of the "easier" parts of this challenge. For me the most challenging part was actually being able to import/export all the pre-built files correctly. I appreciated the setup once I figured it out and finished MVP because I was able to identify ways to improve my own practice. Once I figured that out it all fell into place. I plan on spending some time making a React front-end for this app over the weekend to improve my score from 2 stars (finished MVP) to 3 stars.

          <p class="weeklyp">Another busy week at Lambda School but busy in the best way. I picked up a lot of material and met a lot of cool people in the part-time program. I now know that I'm able to pickup a new technology and be able to learn them in a relatively short amount of time. I look forward to our last full week of instruction next week when we get into testing before starting our back-end project and wrapping up the front-end portion of the curriculum. It's gone by really fast and we've come so far in a short amount of time, amazing.  </p>
