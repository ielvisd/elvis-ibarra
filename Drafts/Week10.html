            <p class="weeklyp"> This was a really busy week outside of coding so I'll keep it brief. I spent some time practicing Python & doing some coding challenges to stay sharp. I was busy getting the house ready for a couple of friends that are moving in so I had to miss the Hackathon but am definitely planning on doing the summer one! Hyped to start Labs!
