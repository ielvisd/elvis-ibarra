    <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> Sprint 15 - <span class="weeklytitle">Project Week: Back End </span></h2>
<p class="intro">
15 weeks down, 1/2 way thru Lambda School's full stack web development curriculum. What a ride. Today I presented the project that I have been working on all week to my entire cohort during demo hour. I was nervous but I knew that my project worked and that even though I didn't have the fanciest of features, it was functional and I had built it using all the skills I had gained over the past 15 weeks. I deployed my front end (built with React/Redux) to Github Pages and the Back End through Heroku. I am so happy that it went well and that I was able to pull of this project and hit some stretch goals. I'm so glad that I decided to apply and attend Lambda School. As my instructor Luis said "What if I told you that Lambda Notes was only the beginning?"  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learn to program <a href="https://twitter.com/LambdaSchool?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LambdaSchool</a>‚ù§Ô∏è Awesome curriculum, instructors, pm&#39;s, students &amp; no tuition until after you&#39;ve graduated and are hiredü§Ø Sign up with my ambassador link üî•<a href="https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL">https://t.co/W6OGr1c1EL</a>üî• if you are interested!

          <h4><span class="daytags">Day 1: </span> <span class="day">Setting up the Server & Updating the Front End
    
            </span></h4>
            <p> Got right to work and setup my Trello board with MVP and some stretch goals. I felt confident that I would be able to finish the project but was also slightly nervous because I had been confident in the past only to finish right in the nick of time. I was able to wire up my server and started to adjust some of my routes to point to the new backend instead of Lambda's pre-built server. It was great to make significant progress on day one.   </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2: </span> <span class="day">Deploying the Backend & Updating Routes on the Front End
          </span></h4>
        <p> I essentially hit MVP on this day. I had my front end and back end working nicely by the end of the day but I knew there was a problem. I had not changed my production to be postgres which would give my database real persistence. Our instructor was going over this in the following lecture so I made sure my project was good to go otherwise. Things were ready. </p>

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Postgres Update & JWT Authentication</span></h4>
                <p> Our instructor showed us how to deploy our backend to Heroku and make modifications necessary to chagne the database to postgres in production. This brought a few tiny changes I needed to make to my code on to make it to work how it was before but nothign too complicated. After I had this setup I spent most of my time getting an authentication system to work. I was so happy to see a JWT token after a user had logged in when I was done.

        <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Small Tweaks and Presenting to the Cohort</span></h4>
        <p>Now that my authentication was working I started to make some modifications to the front-end with the new routes and logic. I commented this out just before the demo because I ran out of time in incorporating this logged in status to a user's personal notes but is definitely something I"ll be revisiting over the break. The demo was the most nerve-wracking part but I quickly got over it once I committed to doing it and prepped my project with a practice run-through. Really though, I was so happy it was all working with about 2 minutes to spare. It went well and it was bitter-sweet to be done with this part of the course. Some of us will be moving onto labs, some to CS and some will be full-time PM's. I'm not sure what I'll be doing yet (Labs or CS) but I'll keep you posted.

          <p class="weeklyp"> So I just found out that I was selected to be part of a pilot group that is doing Labs before the CS portion of the curriculum. This morning I saw the current Labs group present and was blown away by all the awesome projects. I'm looking forward to the next step in this awesome journey. Over the break I plan on working some more on the playlist app that we began working on over Thanksgiving Break and learning some Vue.js.  </p>
