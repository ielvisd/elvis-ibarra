            <p class="weeklyp"> This week I worked on updating my Lambda Notes project to have working authentication that would show only the notes belonging to the logged in user. I ran into many roadblocks but I was able to power through and get things working after dropping in and out of the code over the week. The last thing I want to add to this project other than a final styling and responsiveness check is the ability for users to share notes with each other. Once I implement that I can move on to studying some Python and maybe dabbling with some Vue. I also want to start applying to some jobs to see what's out there and start exploring the opportunities I see. See you next week! =)
