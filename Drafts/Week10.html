  <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> Sprint 10 - <span class="weeklytitle">Project Week: Front-End</span></h2>
  <p class="intro">
    It is Friday morning the day after we (FSW14) completed Project Week for the Front End portion of the Full Stack Web Development Curriculum at LambdaSchool. We were tasked with building a minimum viable product (MVP) for a note taking app called "Lambda Notes" for our "client", which was our instructor. This project was really challenging but so much fun. I completed MVP early Thursday morning but didn't put the finishing touches on the project until about half an hour to demo hour. Probably the most thrilling week so far in my time at Lambda.    <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

      </span></h4>
      <p> 
        Having been through a project week already while attending LambdaSchool I was much better prepared this go around because I kind of knew what to expect going in. The project as a to-do notes app that we had to create using React given some design files which were just visuals for what the app should look like. We worked on the project from Monday to Thursday at 2pm at which point some of our cohort presented to the group and then follow that with a smaller group presentation with your project manager. I had setup my Trello board the previous night and had an idea for what MVP looked like. The app needed to fetch notes from a server, display them, display a single note, edit a note, and delete a post. Using Redux was a "stretch goal" and thus not required but I felt comfortable with it from the previous week and it seemed like a logical choice for this app, I cleared that with my Project Manager and got underway.</p> <div class='postImages'> <img class="postImages" src="../images/FE_ProjectWeek_Day1.PNG" alt=""></div>  <p> Day 1 was pretty smooth. I wanted to start easy not do all the MVP at once so I focused on getting my notes to appear using a POST and doing the styling for the main portions. I was feeling good about my progress after day 1 and was at 2/6 on the MVP list.</p>

      <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2: </span> <span class="day">Posting a Note & Reload Issues Emerge
        </span></h4>
      <p>I started to run into issues that would last up until Friday morning when it all came together. I focused on getting a POST request to work and was having trouble getting my page to render all the notes after using a POST request without doing a hard reload of the site. I tried lots of different things and at the end of the day I decided that at least it was working and that maybe if I focused on implementing some of the other MVP features I would fix this one in time. This is when I started to get a working Route implemented which got me to look into WithRouter which solved my Reload issue. I started to wrap my connect with a WithRouter function from my middleware and that moved my Router methods from the Context area of my React tools to my Props. If that made no sense to you don't worry, I basically fixed my reload issue which gave me confidence going into day 3. If I had a working POST method, PUT and DELETE weren't far behind. </p><div class='postImages'> <img class="postImages" src="../images/FE_ProjectWeek_Day2.PNG" alt=""></div>   <p>I was at 2/6 MVP and feeling okay about the project and the week so far. For some reason I thought we had until Friday for this project and something clicked on this night that the project was actually due Thursday! I still thought I could wrap MVP up by Wednesday night so I wasn't too worried.  </p>

      <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">WithRouter Saves the Day MVP a Day Away</span></h4>
      <p>
        Wednesday was Halloween and also the the day I spent the most time with this project. It was quite spooky. I spent most of the day coding away and by the end of the night I had gotten MVP with some quirks and styling that didn't feel quite right. I definitely was not happy with my product that night but I had the following day to change my simple inputs that were placeholders for a full form and get my delete modal finished which is what I needed to feel satisfied with my project. I was feeling awesome about being able to problem solve and make progress every single day.</p><div class='postImages'> <img class="postImages" src="../images/FE_ProjectWeek_Day2.PNG" alt=""></div>   <p>Even though I was at 6/6 on the MVP list I was not complete in my head until I had a working modal and a form with multi-line text and not just 2 inputs on a screen. 1 day to go.

      <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Demo Day - Lambda Notes - FSW14</span></h4>
      <p>The delete modal was a little tricker than I thought but since I had most of the morning to focus on it I got that and my form conversion done right at around 1:30pm. It was so cool to see something that you created come to life and work as expected. Sure there are things I could improve but this was mine and it worked =) At 2pm we all met to watch some of our classmates present. Awesome stuff. We have some very talented individuals in my cohort who did some really cool things with their projects. One of the major differences from this go around to last project week was that this time my reaction was "That's awesome, I can see how they did that and can't wait to implement that on my next project." instead of "Wow, that's so awesome, I have no idea how they did and I'll never be that good".</p><div class='postImagesContainer'> <img class="postImages" src="../images/FE_ProjectWeek_Day2.PNG" alt=""></div> <p>At the end of the day I presented a 6/6 MVP project to my group which used Redux (1 stretch goal) and I am hosting on Github Pages here:</p> <a class="lambda" href="https://ielvisd.github.io/front-end-project-week/"

      <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 9 - Redux Smurfs</span></h4>
      <p>After a week of re-working projects it was only appropriate to re-work a prior Sprint as well. We were tasked with building a React/Redux application that interfaced with a Smurfs API asynchronously. I finished on time but didn't have the functionality I wanted. I hit some stretch goals with deletion but still haven't mastered an edit feature. After spending some time today looking at my code I fixed my mistake which involved not passing a dispatch correctly when adding a Smurf which caused me to have to reload the page to se my new list. Fixing this cleared up many things and it's always a good idea to check out the solution to the Sprint after you pass to see what you could've improved.  </p>

    <p class="weeklyp">The major difference I noticed in how I worked this week compared to last was that I was less flustered when I didn't get something right way. I remembered a theme during the after hours lecture which is that the code is doing precisely what I told it to do and that each error has a meaning and a purpose. Sometimes it may be tough to find out just what that is but that is our job as programmers. This made redux issues more enjoyable and the learning process a lot smoother this week. Next week is project week which means our last week with our 2nd instructor and another week-long project where we get to display all we've learned so far.</p>
