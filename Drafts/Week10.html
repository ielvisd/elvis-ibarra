  <h2><span class="cs14">FSW14</span> Sprint 10 - <span class="weeklytitle">Project Week: Front-End</span></h2>
  <p class="intro">
    It is Friday morning the day after we (FSW14) completed Project Week for the Front End portion of the Full Stack Web Development Curriculum at LambdaSchool. We were tasked with building a minimum viable product (MVP) for a note taking app called "Lambda Notes" for our "client", which was our instructor. This project was really challenging but so much fun. I completed MVP early Thursday morning but didn't put the finishing touches on the project until about half an hour to demo hour. Probably the most thrilling week so far in my time at Lambda.    <a class="lambda" href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/cs-fsw#full-stack-web-development-core-1"

        Ok, now that my Sprint project is fixed I can finish my weekly blog post. On Monday we were introduced to Redux and it was definitely a lot of information but the project was manageable and after asking a cohort member for some help with one part of my code I was done with the first project and had begun to setup the next day's project. At this point I had an idea of what Redux was and how to use it but was still iffy on some of the basics such as the difference between the Redux state tree and the React component states. These concepts cleared up with some more practice on days 2-5.  </p>

      <h4><span class="daytags">Day 2:</span> <span class="day">Redux Fundamentals II
        </span></h4>
      <p>On day 2 we explored how Redux is based on the immutability (don't mess with data) principle and the methods/techniques we can use to take advantage of Redux's state tree. Our project was to re-create a project we had completed before but using Redux, this was a to-do list app. I didn't finish on time but this project was the one that started to clear things up. I didn't finish because I was mixing up component state and my redux state. After some research I came across a GitHup post where Redux's creator is addressing this exact topic and explaining the differences and when to use which. It was great to see the main developer involved in his project and helping others out who are trying to use his technology. I started to see the possibilities with Redux and how smooth it could be. </p>

      <h4><span class="daytags">Day 3:</span> <span class="day">Async Redux - Redux Thunk I</span></h4>
      <p>
        This was a powerful day. We learned about middleware in Redux that lets you do things to actions before they hit the reducer, which, in turn, let you do asynchronous calls in your applications. We rebuilt another previous application today which interacted with a Star Wars server and returned some characters. I got this project done on time which was a great relief from the day before and gave me a confidence boost in learning Redux.

      <h4><span class="daytags">Day 4:</span> <span class="day">Async Redux - Redux Thunk II</span></h4>
      <p>The last day of instruction for the week and we explored asynchronous calls in more detail. We rebuilt yet another application we had worked on before but this time there was no pre-provided code so we had to whip up the whole thing from scratch. This was a pretty cool experience and it definitely prepared me for the next day's Sprint challenge. I didn't finish what I wanted to on time but I got the bulk of the project done.</p>

      <h4><span class="daytags">Day 5:</span> <span class="day">Sprint 9 - Redux Smurfs</span></h4>
      <p>After a week of re-working projects it was only appropriate to re-work a prior Sprint as well. We were tasked with building a React/Redux application that interfaced with a Smurfs API asynchronously. I finished on time but didn't have the functionality I wanted. I hit some stretch goals with deletion but still haven't mastered an edit feature. After spending some time today looking at my code I fixed my mistake which involved not passing a dispatch correctly when adding a Smurf which caused me to have to reload the page to se my new list. Fixing this cleared up many things and it's always a good idea to check out the solution to the Sprint after you pass to see what you could've improved.  </p>

    <p class="weeklyp">The major difference I noticed in how I worked this week compared to last was that I was less flustered when I didn't get something right way. I remembered a theme during the after hours lecture which is that the code is doing precisely what I told it to do and that each error has a meaning and a purpose. Sometimes it may be tough to find out just what that is but that is our job as programmers. This made redux issues more enjoyable and the learning process a lot smoother this week. Next week is project week which means our last week with our 2nd instructor and another week-long project where we get to display all we've learned so far.</p>
